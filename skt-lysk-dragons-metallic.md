# Metallic Dragons

___
Metallic dragons seek to **preserve and protect**, viewing themselves as one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the world.

#### Brass Dragon

* **Alignment**: Chaotic Good
* **Habitat:** Deserts, hot and dry climates; love sunlight
* **Breath Weapon:** Fire or sleep

___
**Very Gregarious:** A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon’s presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon’s thirst for small talk is slaked.

#### Copper Dragon

* **Alignment**: Chaotic Good
* **Habitat:** Hills and rocky uplands
* **Breath Weapon:** Acid or slow

___
**Incorrigible Pranksters, Joke Tellers, and Riddlers:** A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn’t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor. Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.

Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.

#### Bronze Dragon

* **Alignment**: Lawful Good
* **Habitat:** Coasts of ocean or deep freshwater
* **Breath Weapon:** Lightning or repulsion

___
**Srong sense of Justice:** Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.

Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship’s captain for the item.

Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.

* **Alignment**: Lawful Good
* **Habitat:** Clouds or mountain peaks
* **Breath Weapon:** Cold or paralyzing

___
**Friendliest Dragons, Strong Sense of Morality:** Silver dragons are very social and cheerfully assist good creatures in need. They believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one’s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don’t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.

Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.

#### Gold Dragon

* **Alignment**: Lawful Good
* **Habitat:** Anywhere
* **Breath Weapon:** Fire or weakening

___
**Powerful and Majestic:** Gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil. They are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.

Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn’t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren’t bribes.

Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.

### Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon

___
**King of Good Dragons:** The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries — actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.
