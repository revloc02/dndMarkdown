## Alignment

Alignment is a shorthand for a character's (or religion's, society's, organization's, etc.) moral and ethical outlook on life, the universe, and everything. Broadly describes moral and personal attitudes of creatures. For PCs alignment is descriptive not prescriptive.

#### Lawful-Neutral-Chaotic Axis
Law. Attitudes toward society and order. Lawful creatures respect authority, honor tradition, and follow the law. Chaotic creatures follow their consciences regardless of the law, resent being told what to do, and favor new ideas over old cultural traditions.

#### Good-Neutral-Evil Axis
Morality. Good creatures protect innocent life and keep their word. Evil disregards life and will lie, cheat, and steal without conscience.
