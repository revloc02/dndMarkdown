## Legendary Template

Legendary Actions are one of the best-regarded mechanics of the 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons, providing DMs the tools to accurately portray the deadliness of higher-level creatures. You know you are in trouble when the dragon simply retaliates your sword slash with a tail sweep without even waiting for its own turn.

This feature along with Legendary Resistance however is restricted to very powerful monsters, those we call--quite appropriately--legendary. But what if there was a way to incorporate such mechanics to lesser threats, making them more dangerous to give your players a harder time!

### What is Legendary?
One of the first things to consider is the fact that not all creatures that receive some Legendary Actions need to be stuff of legends. It is perfectly fine to imagine an immensely powerful goblin (for goblin standards, that is) who is feared by all goblinkind, justifying the acquisition of such Legendary Actions, but it is also possible that what you need is simply a better specimen who can pose a higher challenge to adventuring groups.

### Tiers

Therefore five tiers are presented: **Elite**, **Boss**, **Epic**, **Legendary**, and beyond legendary: **Godly**. These tiers are relative--an epic goblin might still be an easy kill for a group, but an boss troll will probably prove a worthier foe.

Modifying a creature to one of the five tiers allows them the capability of taking Legendary Actions (or Elite, Boss, or Epic Actions if you will) a number of times as shown in the following table. The creature also acquires the Legendary Resistance trait, usable a number of times per day, also expressed in the table.

| Tier      | Legendary Actions<sup>\*</sup> / Resistances<sup>\*\*</sup> | CR |
|:----------|:---:|:-----:|
| Elite     | 1 or the other | +1 |
| Boss      | 1   | +2 |
| Epic      | 2   | +3 |
| Legendary | 3   | +4-5 |
| Godly     | 4-5 | +6-7 |

#### Legendary Actions

Modified creatures can perform the following Legendary Actions after another creature’s turn, provided they can “pay” the action cost for them. For example, an elite creature will not be able to perform Legendary Actions that cost 2 actions because they can only take 1 such action per round. The creature regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of its turn.

* **Attack:** The creature makes a single melee or ranged attack.
* **Move:** The creature moves up to its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.
* **Cast a Cantrip:** The creature casts a cantrip, provided it is able to cast spells.
* **Special Ability (Costs 2 Actions):** The creature uses one of its special abilities that require an action, provided that it has such an ability.
* **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions):** The creature casts a spell, provided it is able to cast spells.
* **Multiattack (Costs 2 Actions):** The creature uses its multiattack, provided it already has such an action option.
* **All-Out (Costs 3 Actions):** The creature moves up to its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity and uses its special ability, spell, or multiattack, provided it already has such an action option.

#### Legendary Resistance

If the creature fails a saving throw it can choose to succeed instead.

#### Challenge Rating

Increase the creature's CR by the number shown in the table. Consider any creature of CR 1/2 or lower as having a CR of 0 for the purpose of this calculation. Therefore an Elite kobold becomes a CR 1 opponent, while a Legendary kobold turns into a CR 4 challenge.

### Increasing Hit Points

A creature with a Legendary Template gets a boost on hit points to help it make a stand against prepared adventurers. Use the table to determine the creatures new CR, and then multiply the new CR by 10 and add that many HPs to the creatures HP pool.

* **HP bonus = new CR x 10**

If this seems overly complex then just simply give the creature however many HPs you want.
