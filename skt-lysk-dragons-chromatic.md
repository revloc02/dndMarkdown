# Chromatic Dragons

Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures — including each other. They are driven by greed and are creatures of ego. They are presented here in order from the least powerful to the most.

#### White Dragon

* **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
* **Habitat:** Arctic areas or icy mountains
* **Breath Weapon:** Cold

**Primal and Vengeful:** White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, they are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.

#### Black Dragon

* **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
* **Habitat:** Fetid swamps and crumbling ruins
* **Breath Weapon:** Acid

**Brutal and Cruel:** The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.

#### Green Dragon

* **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
* **Habitat:** forests
* **Breath Weapon:** Poison

**Manipulative Schemers:** A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted.

#### Blue Dragon

* **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
* **Habitat:** deserts, dry steppes, searing badlands
* **Breath Weapon:** Poison

**Vain and Territorial Overlords:** A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.

#### Red Dragon

* **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
* **Habitat:** mountainous terrain, badlands; volcanic or geothermal caves
* **Breath Weapon:** Fire

**Arrogant Tyrants:** The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.

### Tiamat, Queen of Evil Dragons

Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.

Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her — black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.

Tiamat’s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen’s power.
