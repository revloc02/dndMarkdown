# The Ordning

</div>

Giant society (such as it is) is defined in large part by the ordning, a caste structure imposed upon the giants by their gods, chief among them Annam the All-Father. **The ordning determines where giants stand among their own kind**. Traditionally, **storm giants** have stood at the top of the ordning. Tall and powerful, they struggle to keep the weaker races of giants from despoiling the realms of small folk and sparking conflict. The greatest storm giants are powerful seers, skilled at identifying and interpreting cosmic signs and divine omens. The aloof and aristocratic **cloud giants**, one step below the storm giants, rarely condescend to deal with lesser giants or small folk. Extravagance defines their culture and their place in the ordning.

Below them are the tyrannical, warmongering fire giants and the merciless, predatory frost giants. **Fire giants** rank themselves by their forging skill, whereas **frost giants** rank themselves by their martial prowess. Near the bottom of the ordning are the xenophobic **stone giants**, who mostly live underground and regard the surface world as a realm of dreams. How well they sculpt stone determines their place among their peers. The lowest and smallest of the true giants are the **hill giants**, as gluttonous as they are loathsome. Hill giants are quite stupid, but they do understand that the biggest rule, especially amongst themselves.

Each of the main giant races—the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants—are called **True Giants**. They are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.

There are also other giant races that are related to true giants known as **giant-kin**. Fomorian, Ettin, Ogres, and Verbeeg are typically evil, and are ranked below all other giants. All true giants considered these types of giant-kin unholy.

**Because of the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it**. Regardless of a giant’s rank within its own race, the chief hill giant is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn’t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, rather merely rude. Additionally, each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these racial qualities the purpose of their lives.
