# Giants

___
Giants are very powerful and it might not be in ones best interest to always fight them. In fact, sometimes it is best to just hide or run.

### Hill Giant

* **Height**: 16'
* **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
* **Habitat:** Hills and mountain valleys
* **Ordning:** Physical strength and eating ability

___
**Selfish, Dimwitted Brutes:** Hill giants hunt, forage, and raid in constant search of food. They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, and because of their **laziness** and formidable size and strength, they bully smaller creatures into feeding them. Hill giants dwell in steadings built of rough timber. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the **reek** of the crude animal skins they wear.

### Frost Giant

* **Height**: 21'
* **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
* **Habitat:** High peaks and glacial rifts
* **Ordning:** Physical might, scars, single combat trophies

___
**Fierce, Hardy Warriors:** Gigantic reavers from the freezing lands beyond civilization, frost giants survive on the spoils of their raids and pillaging. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies. Frost giants are **barbarians** of ice and snow with hair and beards that are pale white or light blue, matted with frost and clattering with icicles. They dwell in arctic lands where crops don’t grow, but they do keep a little livestock beyond what they capture in their **raids** against civilized lands. They **hunt** the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don’t cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.

### Stone Giant

* **Height**: 18'
* **Alignment**: Neutral
* **Habitat:** Secluded caves
* **Ordning:** Hurling and catching enormous boulders

___
**Reclusive, Quiet, and Peaceful:** Stone giants are peaceful as long as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants with a **stern** countenance. They are private creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world. Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.

In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at **elaborate carvings**. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stonecraft of the dwarves.

### Fire Giant

* **Height**: 18'
* **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
* **Habitat:** Volcanoes, lava floes, and rocky mountains
* **Ordning:** Strength and forgecraft skill

___
**Master Crafters and Organized Warriors:** Fire are ruthless militaristic brutes whose mastery of **metalwork** is legendary. Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants’ forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional **smithies** occupy places of honor.

### Cloud Giant

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/lCcVIul.png' style='position:absolute;top:330px;right:60px;width:320px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(110%)saturate(250%);' />

* **Height**: 24'
* **Alignment**: Neutral Good or Neutral Evil
* **Habitat:** High mountain peaks, or atop solid clouds
* **Ordning:** Treasure, wealth, and gifts to other cloud giants

___
**Aloof Spellcasters:** Cloud giants live extravagant lives high above the world, showing little concern for the plights of other races except as amusement. They are muscular with light skin and have hair of silver or blue.

Better spellcasters than most other giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer the wind almost as well as their cousins, the storm giants.

Cloud giants are spread to the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. In times of need, scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan. However, they can seldom do so quickly.

Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in castles on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their fiefs. Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting remnant of the giants’ lost empires.

### Storm Giant

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/w3EuM0y.jpg?1' style='position:absolute;bottom:0px;right:0px;width:420px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(150%);' />

* **Height**: 26'
* **Alignment**: Chaotic Good
* **Habitat:** High in the sky or at the ocean's bottom
* **Ordning:** They don’t compete for status in the ordning

___
**Contemplative Seers:** Storm giants are contemplative seers that live in places far removed from mortal civilization. Most have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes. Some rare storm giants are violet-skinned, with deep violet or blue-black hair and silvery gray or purple eyes. They are benevolent and wise unless angered, in response to which the fury of a storm giant can affect the fate of thousands. Storm giants live in isolated refuges so far above the surface of the world or below the sea that they are beyond the reach of most other creatures. Some make their abodes in cloud-top castles so high that flying dragons appear as specks below. Others live atop mountain peaks that pierce the clouds. Some occupy palaces covered with algae and coral at the bottom of the ocean, or grim fortresses in undersea rifts.

# The Ordning

</div>

Giant society (such as it is) is defined in large part by the ordning, a caste structure imposed upon the giants by their gods, chief among them Annam the All-Father. The ordning determines where a giant stands among his or her ilk. Traditionally, storm giants have stood at the top of the ordning. Tall and powerful, they struggle to keep the weaker races of giants from despoiling the realms of small folk and sparking conflict. The greatest storm giants are powerful seers, skilled at identifying and interpreting cosmic signs and divine omens. The aloof and aristocratic cloud giants, one step below the storm giants, rarely condescend to deal with lesser giants or small folk. Extravagance defines their culture and their place in the ordning. Below them are the tyrannical, warmongering fire giants and the merciless, predatory frost giants. Fire giants rank themselves by their forging skill, whereas frost giants rank themselves by their martial prowess. Near the bottom of the ordning are the xenophobic stone giants, who mostly live underground and regard the surface world as a realm of dreams. How well they sculpt stone determines their place among their peers. The lowest and smallest of the true giants are the hill giants, as gluttonous as they are loathsome. Hill giants are quite stupid, but they do understand that the biggest rule, especially amongst themselves.

Each of the main giant races—the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants—are called True Giants. They are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.

There are also other giant races that are related to true giants known as giant-kin. Fomorian, Ettin, Ogres, and Verbeeg are typically evil, and are ranked below all other giants. All true giants considered these types of giant-kin unholy.

Because of the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it. Regardless of a giant’s rank within its own race, the chief hill giant is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn’t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, rather merely rude. Additionally, each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these racial qualities the purpose of their lives.

# Giant Lords

#### Chief Guh

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/NWC4i82.png' style='position:absolute;top:-10px;right:20px;width:380px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(130%)saturate(300%);transform:rotate(0deg)scaleX(-1)scaleY(1);' />

Guh, a gluttonous hill giant chief, has raised an enormous timber steading in the hills northeast of Goldenfields, in the central Dessarin Valley. Comfortably housed within her lair, Guh has instructed her husbands to bring her all the food they can carry. Her plan is to consume all that is brought before her and grow to immense size. When she becomes the largest giant in the world, Guh believes the gods will reward her and elevate hill giants to the top of the ordning. Guh has spent the past four months gorging herself, while nearby ranches, farmsteads, and orchards have been pillaged. Not content with the amount of food hoarded thus far, Guh’s mates move to attack nearby settlements and plunder their fields and storehouses.

#### Thane Kayalithica

/>

After fleeing Hekaton’s court, Kayalithica, an inscrutable stone giant thane, withdrew to her canyon sanctuary of Deadstone Cleft. There, in its hallowed halls, she hoped to elevate her people to the top of the ordning by first seeking divine inspiration. Deadstone Cleft is hidden within the Graypeak Mountains, east of Delimbiyr Vale and the High Forest, and northeast of the mining settlement of Llorkh. After weeks of meditation, Kayalithica concluded that the small folk had corrupted the dreams of all giants by building their wretched settlements on the bones of ancient Ostoria. She intends to wipe the land clean of their “filth,” thus restoring the “dream world” to its rightful state. Kayalithica’s stone giants strike forth from Deadstone Cleft to destroy the works of humans, dwarves, and elves, then return to carve the tales of their accomplishments into the walls for the gods to see and admire.

#### Jarl Storvald

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/lxO5N6E.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-20px;right:10px;width:380px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(200%);' />

Storvald, a fierce and adventurous frost giant jarl, traveled to the coldest reaches of the Sea of Moving Ice to reclaim Svardborg, the ancestral home of his forebears. He found a nest of white dragon eggs within the iceberg fortress and successfully enslaved a mated pair of white dragons by holding their eggs hostage. Within a matter of months thereafter, he also freed several gigantic longships from the ice and sent his giant raiders out to attack smaller ships and plunder their supplies, as well as to pillage wood from the mainland to repair the damaged ships and lodges of Svardborg.

Storvald has childhood memories of a legend about the Ice That Never Melts—a powerful, frost-coated golden ring that can freeze the oceans and blanket the world in mountains of snow. Small folk know this artifact by another name: the Ring of Winter. The ring, which grants immortality to its wearer, was last seen in the possession of a human adventurer (and former Harper) named Artus Cimber. Guided by magical runes of tracking, Storvald plans to find the ring and bring about the Age of Everlasting Ice, thus ensuring his place at the top of the ordning. Storvald procured a drop of Cimber’s blood from a Zhentarim wizard named Nilraun, and used the drop to empower his runes.

#### Duke Zalto

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/pfPyXrG.png' style='position:absolute;top:0px;right:0px;width:300px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(130%);transform:rotate(0deg)scaleX(-1)scaleY(1);' />

Zalto, a fire giant duke, believes that he can become the ruler of all giants by slaughtering their ancient enemies: dragons. Duke Zalto has set his minions to the task of finding and unearthing fragments of a dragon-slaying colossus called the Vonindod (“titan of death”). Pieces of it were lost in battle, while the rest was dismantled at the end of the ancient war between giants and dragonkind. Once all the pieces are found, Zalto plans to reforge the Vonindod and unleash it on the world. Beneath the Ice Spires lies an ancient fire giant forge called Ironslag. Unfortunately for Zalto, Ironslag’s forges aren’t hot enough to repair the colossus. The duke, undaunted, plans to steal Maegera, the fire primordial trapped in the subterranean dwarven fortress-city of Gauntlgrym, and trap it within Ironslag’s adamantine forge. The dwarves rely on Maegera to heat their own forges. Hesitant to storm the dwarven fortress, Zalto has met with drow representatives of House Xorlarrin, who know the layout of Gauntlgrym well. With their aid, the fire giant duke plans to imprison Maegera in an iron flask and transport the primordial to Ironslag—a goal easier imagined than accomplished.

#### Countess Sansuri

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/bmtsceL.png' style='position:absolute;top:270px;right:170px;width:270px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(110%)saturate(300%);' />

Sansuri, a vainglorious cloud giant countess, is one of several cloud giant nobles who have retreated to their cloud castles and embarked on expeditions to map the present-day Sword Coast in search of long-lost Ostorian treasures and battlegrounds. Like archaeologists, they seek to uncover secrets of the past and retrieve relics of their ancient history to impress the gods. Sansuri, a powerful wizard, is searching for something more: a long-lost trove of dragon magic, hidden away by her ancestors. Once cloud giants knock storm giants from the pinnacle of the ordning, she plans to use her newfound magic to destroy her rivals as well as Hekaton’s court. But the countess is not happy at present, because her search for the lost trove has not been going well. Frustrated, Sansuri has used powerful magic and guile to capture a bronze dragon named Felgolos. She is torturing the wyrm for information. The dragon’s terrible roars can be heard emanating from Sansuri’s cloud castle for miles in every direction.

#### King Hekaton

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/ocv15pj.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-20px;right:-30px;width:380px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(150%);' />

King Hekaton is the most powerful of all storm giants. From Maelstrom, his citadel deep within the Trackless Sea, he presides over a court that includes representatives of every race of giant, from mighty storm giants to lowly hill giants. Hekaton’s family consists of his wife Neri and three daughters, Mirran, Nym, and Serissa. He uses the power of the Wyrmskull Throne—a gift given to him by his wife—to keep the more unruly giants in line.

Hekaton’s wife, Queen Neri, is particularly fond of the small folk (humans, elves, and dwarves). She visits them often rising up out of the sea to meet them on the shores of the Sword Coast. Neri continually urges her husband to respect the civilizations of the small folk and leave them alone, if he could not countenance forming alliances with them. Hekaton, inherently distrustful of the small folk, wants nothing to do with them, but he respects his wife’s desire to treat with them on occasion.

# Metallic Dragons

#### Brass Dragon

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/zcrKpTe.png' style='position:absolute;top:0px;right:0px;width:408px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(100%);' />

The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.

A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon’s presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature. When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon’s thirst for small talk is slaked.

A brass dragon’s desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling holes to allow for sunlight.

#### Copper Dragon

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/bINmjwn.png' style='position:absolute;top:300px;right:-20px;width:448px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(100%);transform:rotate(0deg)scaleX(-1)scaleY(1);' />

Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.

A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn’t laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.

Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.

Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves.

#### Bronze Dragon

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/Agr1mOj.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-40px;right:20px;width:400px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(100%);' />

Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.

Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship’s captain for the item.

Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.

A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.

#### Silver Dragon

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/IrcsEWI.png' style='position:absolute;top:0px;right:-40px;width:540px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(200%);transform:rotate(0deg)scaleX(-1)scaleY(1);' />

The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.

Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one’s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don’t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.

Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.

Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.

#### Gold Dragon

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/Xx4EvqS.png' style='position:absolute;top:370px;right:-20px;width:458px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(100%);transform:rotate(0deg)scaleX(-1)scaleY(1);' />

The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil.

Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn’t need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren’t bribes.

Gold dragons are respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness, but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other dragons except their own mates and offspring.

Gold dragons make their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling waterfalls, or ancient ruins.

### Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon

<img src='http://francklebon.f.r.pic.centerblog.net/q3884kyc.jpg' style='position:absolute;bottom:38px;right:0px;width:410px; mix-blend-mode:multiply;filter:brightness(120%)saturate(120%);' />

King of Good Dragons. The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries — actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.

Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.

# Bryn Shander

Bryn Shander is the largest of ten settlements known collectively as Ten-Towns, located in the frigid heart of Icewind Dale. Here, caravans from the south converge with traders from across Icewind Dale to swap goods and rumors. Fishers, trappers, furriers, and sellswords rub elbows in the town’s taprooms, and gruff dwarves, wide-eyed travelers, and skulking ne’er-do-wells wander its streets. Merchants from the south trade dyes, hardwood, dried herbs and spices, textiles, fruits, wines, and other commodities for scrimshaw and other items made from the bones of the knucklehead trout that populate the region’s rivers and lakes.

The town is situated atop a hill south of the mountain known as Kelvin’s Cairn, a major landmark in Icewind Dale. From its windswept perch, Bryn Shander has a commanding view of the surrounding tundra, and an attacking force must climb the barren hillside under fire from archers before it can assault the outer wall. The circular wall that surrounds Bryn Shander stands 30 feet high and is made of tight-fitting stone blocks. Defenders stand atop a planked walkway that hugs interior of the wall. Spaced along the wall are stone watchtowers, wherein guards can take shelter during blizzards and warm their hands and feet by iron stoves.

The buildings of Bryn Shander are plain wooden structures with pitched rooftops to keep snow from settling on them. Clouds of white smoke issue forth day and night from stone chimneys and holes in rooftops.

Each community in Ten-Towns has an elected speaker who leads the residents and represents their interests. The current speaker of Bryn Shander is Duvessa Shane. She has appointed Markham Southwell as her sheriff, making him responsible for training the town’s militia and keeping the peace.
