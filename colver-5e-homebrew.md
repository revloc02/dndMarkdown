# Campaign World Setting

The world in which you play is low magic but epic fantasy. What does that mean? It means, that magic and magic items are rare and special, but the player characters are also rare and special. They are the heroes and will rise as such, and eventually become as epic and legendary as the players can imagine.

### Adventurers are Rare

Adventuring is not an occupation, rather it is a side effect of fulfilling a more pressing need—saving the town, completing the quest from the Duke, or finding the lost princess.

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** When using official D&D content where there is frequent mention of adventurers, often replacing that with mercenaries is a suitable substitute.

</div>

### Magic is Uncommon

Magic is...well, magical. Cantrips are fairly common, but anything above that becomes rare pretty quickly.

### Magic Items are Very Rare

There is no such thing as a magic shop. Sometimes it is possible to find someone who sells some potions, and there is the occasional odd sale of a common (speaking relatively) magic item, but generally magic items, although real, are very rare.

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** This isn't about changing the way treasure is doled out to the party, rather it is much more about the world around them. The PCs are the heroes of the story, so they are going to find wonderful treasures, even a lot of magic items, but this is very unusual in the world.

</div>

### Class Levels are Uncommon

There are NPCs with Class levels, but these are rather uncommon, and are usually the leaders of the world who have some experience.

* Levels 1-3 are fairly common. Lots of folks across the land can level-up from training or defending their homes and cities from time to time.
* Levels 4-6 are uncommon. Many of the leaders—from Captain of the Guard to Guild Leader to Temple Priest, as well as the local feudal lord—are in this category.
* Levels 7-8 are rare. This consists of the greatest heroes, generals, high priests, and feudal leaders.
* Levels 9-10 are very rare. Only the most powerful kings and greatest arch-mages attain this level.
* Levels 10+ are only known in legends. Campaign humanoid NPCs with class levels will not exist in this category, thus PC adversaries will be high CR monsters.

A town militia would consist of a bunch of peasants run by a 1st or 2nd level Fighter. City guards would be no more than 3rd level, with a Captain that is 3rd to 5th level. Renowned heroes, a king's Champion, or feudal lords would be 8th level, some might be as high as 10th level but that would be fairly unique. The great and powerful wizard studying in his tower would be 6th to 10th level. Achilles, Aragorn and Legolas, Conan, and Drizzt are examples of legendary characters that might be 10th level as they are powerful, competent, and heroic, but not invincible. Most people are just ordinary people and class levels are exceptional.

But none of this prevents any player character from attaining any levels all the way to 20th, or beyond, if the DM has parameters for it.

### Epic 10

This essentially outlines what is called Epic 10. In other words, the pinnacle of human achievement a person can reach by ordinary means is level 10. The point of Epic 10 is not to limit the players, but to limit the world around them. Players are clever, ambitious, and always surprising. Players will find ways to circumvent any limitation or obstacle in front of them.

However, in an Epic 10 world, there is no magic higher than level 5. This means teleportation is limited, resurrection is much harder to find, advanced scrying is restricted, wishes are extremely rare, and many other powerful spells are unavailable through conventional means.

#### Higher Level Magic

Magic more powerful than level 5 spells are still possible and still exist in the world, but they are not utility magics that can be cast in seconds or minutes.

Frequently, it takes a coven of witches, a circle of druids, or an order of wizards weeks of planning, preparation and concentration to perform more powerful magics.

While these magics may be available to players, it is not quick, easy, or cheap. Commissioning a high-level spell is like embarking on a construction project, with all the complications that go with it.

# D&D Player Etiquette
Here are some simple guidelines for helping to make the D&D session great.


* Be present:
  * Don't check out, or space off. You get as much fun out of the game as you put into it. If you start getting bored:
    * Help the DM or another player
    * Look up something you’ve been curious about
    * Work on character Aspects or depth
    * Use your imagination to help the game come alive, and then share that
* Be helpful
  * Bring your electronic devices and use them.
  * Learn the rules. You don't have to know everything or learn it all at once, but take time to look things up.
  * Do not look at any of the DMs notes, dice rolls, books, or desk. Stay in your seat!

\columnbreak  

* Be ready
  * Five minutes before and after every session, you will review your character: prepare spells, checking hps, look at an item’s charges, erase potions, and making sure your character is ready to be played with.
  * When it is not your turn, be thinking of what you want to do. If you are not sure about how to do something, start looking it up on your own (instead of waiting to ask the DM about it). Or ask another player about it.
* Have fun:
  * Use your imagination to enjoy the current scene more.
  * Be more descriptive about what you are doing and how your character is doing it.
  * You must roll in the dice tower with a witness.
  * If someone else dictates the party is doing something you don’t want to do, you don’t have to do it. But, you must offer another alternative, or specifically explain what your character is doing instead.

You may choose to not play, but if you don't play your character will not get XP or loot.

# Dying

These rules replace Death Saving Throws. Falling unconscious and rolling one die every turn to see if the player will continue playing is actually not that fun. Allowing the character continued freedom to act and make interesting choices is engaging to the player, which are all three good things. This makes for a slightly grittier game, but not as unforgiving as 1e rules where 0 HPs means immediate death. These rules also add some realism without adding a lot of complexity.

> #### Dying Summary
> - Death Saving Throws are no longer used
> - **Drop to 0 HP:**
>   - Gain the **Dying** condition
>   - Concentration is broken
>   - +1 Exhaustion
> - **Dying** condition:
>   - **End of turn:** +1 Exhaustion
>   - **Suffer Damage:** +1 Exhaustion
>   - **Suffer Crit Hit:** +2 Exhaustion
>   - **Damage >= HP max:** instant death
> - **Regain HP:** **Dying** removed (Exhaustion remains)
> - **Stabilized:** actions to stabilize **restore 1 HP**
> - **First Aid:** Medicine check to stabilize any creature you can touch **DC = 10 + targets exhaustion level**

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a character drops to 0 hit points, he or she gains the **Dying** condition, concentration is broken, and they gain 1 level of Exhaustion. Note that the _Instant Death_ (PHB, p. 197) rules still apply as per RAW when massive damage is taken.

### Dying Condition

_The Dying condition indicates a character is on their way to death and grants multiple rounds to either stop the death or go out with a bang. Urgency is created without removing the characters ability to do something about it. In combination with existing rules about removing level of exhaustion this creates a scenario where the closer a character gets to death the longer it takes for him to recover from the shock of that situation—potentially multiple days to remove all levels of Exhaustion. During that time the character will have some disadvantage on checks and reduced speed (as per the exhaustion levels) and this represents a bit of shell shock or PTSD being suffered by the character._

**Dying** is a special condition that simply means a creature has 0 hit points and is not dead yet. A creature obtains the **Dying** condition immediately when they drop to 0 hit points and looses the condition as soon as they gain any hit points.

The **Dying** condition causes the creature to suffer **+1 Exhaustion** level 1) immediately, 2) at the end of their turn, 3) when they take damage.

**Dying** creatures are conscious. As such spells like _Sleep_ will still affect them. 

Exhaustion gained from **Dying** does not end when the **Dying** condition is lost unless the healing method specifically describes also removing levels of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from **Dying** is like all other exhaustion. As per RAW if a creature gains the sixth level of exhaustion, it is dead. See _Exhaustion_ in _Conditions_ (PHB p. 291) for complete information.

### Falling Prone Instead

When the **Dying** condition imposes suffering **+1 Exhaustion** levels the player may choose that their character instead falls prone. This option is only available if the character has not already been prone this turn.

### Damage while Dying.

If you take any damage while you are **Dying**, you suffer **+1 Exhaustion** level. If you receive a critical hit, you suffer **+2 Exhaustion** levels. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

### Stabilizing a Dying Creature.

Effects that invoke the ***stabilize*** result on a **Dying** creature now do so by healing for one hit point. Stabilization via first aid can be done on any creature you can touch and requires an action and a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check with a DC of 10 + targets Exhaustion level (see [Medicine Skill](#dying-medicine-and-healer-medicine-skill)).

### Optional: Dying Survivor Injury

Creatures that have been stabilized from **Dying** have been at deaths door, which is a very traumatic situation. It may be appropriate to roll on the "Lingering Injuries Table" (DMG ch9) for the creature. 

### Note: Exhaustion Removal
Levels of Exhaustion can be removed in the following ways:

- Greater Restoration spell reduces the target's exhaustion level by one (RAW)
- Potion of Vitality: removes all exhaustion (RAW)
- Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by one, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink (RAW)
- You can use a Healer’s Kit and a Medicine check to remove an extra Exhaustion (see [Healer’s Kit](#dying-medicine-and-healer)) during a long rest (HBR)
- You may spend Inspiration (see [Pool Inspiration](#pool-inspiration)) to reduce Exhaustion (HBR)

<div class='descriptive'>

##### _Exhaustion_ Reference (PHB p. 291)
* 1 - Disadvantage on ability checks
* 2 - Speed halved
* 3 - Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
* 4 - Hit point maximum halved
* 5 - Speed reduced to 0
* 6 - Death
</div>

## Medicine and Healer

These rules make the Medicine skill, the Healer’s Kit, and the Healer Feat more useful.

### Medicine Skill

Here are the uses of the Medicine Skill:
* Diagnose an illnesses, this is typically a role playing check (RAW).
* As an action, a Medicine check, DC 10 + Exhaustion Level, will **stabilize** a dying character thus granting them 1 hp (HBR).
* Evaluate others wounds, this is typically a role playing check (HBR).
* Examine corpses in order determine the cause of death, this is typically a role playing check (HBR).
* Provide long-term care to poisoned or diseased creatures.  When a poisoned or diseased creature is cared for by someone proficient in the Medicine skill (see _Downtime: Recuperating_, PHB, p. 187), they make their recuperation saving throws with advantage (HBR).

### Healer’s Kit

Here are the uses of a Healer’s Kit:
* As an action, you can expend one use of a Healer’s Kit to **stabilize** a creature that has dropped to 0 hit points, without needing to make a Medicine check (RAW).
* As an action, one use of a Healer’s Kit, and a Medicine check, DC 15 + Exhaustion Level, will heal 1d4 hit points during a short rest on a character once per short rest (HBR).
* As an action, one use of a Healer’s Kit, and a Medicine check, DC 23 + Exhaustion Level, will remove one extra level of Exhaustion during a long rest from a character once per long rest (HBR).
* If you expend one use of a Healer’s Kit to treat a poisoned or diseased creature (see _Downtime: Recuperating_, PHB p, 187), they make their recuperation saving throw with advantage (HBR).

### Healer Feat

You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:
* You have advantage on all Medicine checks (HBR).
* When you use a Healer’s Kit to **stabilize** a dying creature, that creature also regains 1d6+4 hit points (HBR).
* As an action, you can spend one use of a Healer’s Kit to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature’s maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can’t regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest (RAW).

\columnbreak

### Downtime Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.  After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.  If you are treated by someone proficient in the Medicine skills, you have advantage on this saving throw.  On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:
* End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

# Hit Dice

____
These are slightly adjusted rules for Hit Dice. Hit points represent both a character's life blood and their general vitality. Healing does not always necessarily mean the closing and mending of wounds and injuries. The loss of hit points can also mean fatigue and thus healing can represent rejuvenation.

> #### Hit Dice Summary:
> - Spending HD is **1HD+CON (exploding)**
> - After **long rest** characters do **not** get a **full heal**
> - After **long rest** characters **regain all HD**
> - During a rest spend **HD to regain HPs**
> - Use a **Reaction** and **spend HD as a bonus die** to the d20 roll for an attack, save, or check
> - Can spend **HD to assist** another creature

### Long Rest

At the end of a long rest, a character **does not** automatically regain any lost hit points. During a short or long rest, a character can spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points. After a long rest, a character regains all spent Hit Dice.

Removing a full character health reset introduces more grit into the game. Characters should consider the lasting consequences of their decisions instead of merely surviving the day. Thus the Hit Dice at the beginning of the day represent all the natural healing and vitality for the entire day regardless of the length of the rest.

_**Example:** Wendy is a level 5 Wizard. She has a total of 5d6 Hit Dice. Currently they are all available. The party just survived a few encounters, in which she got a bit beat up, and is now taking a short rest. Alice is spending the time bandaging wounds. At the end of the short rest she spends a Hit Die (1HD+CON) to regain hit points. It was a low roll so she decides to spend another. Much better. After regaining the hit points she is feeling more confident for the next encounter. Wendy now has two spent Hit Dice and three available Hit Dice. If all goes well in the next encounter she plans to spend the final three Hit Dice after her long rest._

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** It is expected that you should be pushing for 6-8 encounters between long rests. Also worth noting is the existing _Long Rest_ rule that states characters can only benefit from 1 long rest every 24 hours (PHB p. 186).

</div>

### Spending a Hit Die

To spend a Hit Die roll the character's appropriate die and add their Constitution modifier, **exploding** a maximum result (see Glossary). This total number will be applied to the purpose of spending the die. This Hit Die is now considered spent.

\columnbreak

#### Rejuvenation

During a short or long rest a Hit Die can be used to recover hit points.

#### Push Yourself

You can use your Reaction to Push Yourself to your character's limits thus incurring some stress to vitality. The added stress limits your ability to quickly be rejuvenated later. Spend a Hit Die as a bonus die to the d20 roll of an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

_**Example:** Bob the Barbarian is in front line combat against a hoard of lizard folk. Bob uses Action Surge for more attacks in an attempt to finally defeat the lizard king. On his last blow Bob rolls a 2. Sure that he was a single hit away from victory he decides to use his Reaction to push himself. He spends a Hit Die (1HD+CON) getting 13 which he adds to the attack roll making it 15 total. A hit! The lizard king in fact is defeated and the other lizard folk run away on their turn. Bob is unable to take attacks of opportunity on them this round because his Reaction was spent, and it was worth it._

### Assisting your Allies

In an attempt to encourage group collaboration, reliance, and planning you can spend Hit Dice to assist any other creature. This assistance includes Rejuvenation for an ally and Pushing Yourself to assist others during encounters. This turns all the individual Hit Dice pools into one large party Hit Dice pool that the players coordinate.

When spending Hit Dice to rejuvenate hit points during a rest you may only benefit a single creature that your character can touch. Activities of this nature may include applying pressure, wrapping wounds, removing a spearhead from their buttocks, or a good pep talk.

_**Example:** Carla is a Cleric in a bad spot. The red wizard just threw a fireball at her and Frank the Fighter. If she does not succeed at this saving throw she may drop to 0 hit points which would be bad for the entire party. She rolled very low. A Cleric Hit Die is 1d8 and Carla's Constitution modifier is +1. A Fighter Hit Die is 1d10 and Franks Constitution modifier is +3. Frank knows that he has a greater chance of helping Carla and he happens to still have his Reaction available. He Pushes Himself using his Reaction to spend a Hit Die granting Carla a bonus to her Dexterity save. It worked, she made her save and only took half of the damage. In narrative, as the fireball comes crashing down Frank covers Carla shielding her from much of the blast. Its now Franks turn and he uses his Bonus Action to use Second Wind. Everybody is going to make it._

___
> #### Hit Dice Goals:
> - Provide collaboration, interesting player choice
> - Prevent a full character reset during long rest
> - Give more uses for Hit Dice and still keep the theme

# Pool Inspiration

Using these rules, Inspiration is a resource shared between all of the characters of the party. When Inspiration is awarded to a character, the point of Inspiration goes into a party Pool of Inspiration that can be used by any of the players whenever they want or as agreed upon by the group. This encourages the party to work together as a team.

Ideally Inspiration points in the pool should be represented at the table by some physical object such as poker chips, tokens, or counter beads, and kept where all can view and utilize the pool.

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** The limit as to how much Inspiration can be in the pool is up to the DM. A rough rule of thumb is 1 to 3 times the number of characters in the party.

</div>

## Acquiring Inspiration

### Player Request

Inspiration can be obtained by the characters by doing any of the following:
* Invoking any of their **Personal Characteristics** or **Aspects**, by acting in accordance with one of them in a way that creates tension, drama, or authenticity
* Acting **heroically** or taking a significant **risk**
* Being **creative** or clever or **ingenious**

A player announces their intent to get Inspiration by doing one of these actions, i.e. they lobby for Inspiration. This is negotiated with the DM. The player should narrate how their character is performing the deed, and should attempt to make their case more compelling with thrilling drama that is ultimately entertaining.  If the act is intense enough, the DM can even occasionally grant 2 Inspiration for the activity.

### Momentum

* **Momentum:**
As motivation to have the party experience more encounters in a game day, the DM can reward the group, after an encounter, a number of Inspiration points equal to that encounter number for this day. E.g. the party receive 1 Inspiration to their pool after the first encounter of the day, 2 Inspiration after the second, 3 after the third, and so forth.

### DM Decision

* The DM should also freely compel players to invoke Personality Traits on their characters.
* The DM can give out Inspiration whenever he wants for any reason.

\columnbreak

> #### Pool Inspiration Summary
> * Inspiration is a resource shared by the party
> * The Pool of Inspiration can hold lots of points
> * Inspiration is obtained by:
>   * Invoking **Personal Characteristics**
>   * **Heroic risks**
>   * **Ingenuity**
>   * **Momentum** - more encounters per day
> * Inspiration can be used to:
>   * Get **Advantage/Disadvantage**
>   * **Reroll**
>   * **Act Out of Turn**
>   * Do a **Stunt**
>   * Get **Revelation**
>   * Take an **Extra Action**
>   * **Remove Exhaustion**
>   * **Cheat Death**
>   * **Recall** a Spell or Special Ability
>   * Something **Special**

\pagebreakNum



## Spending Inspiration

When a player spends Inspiration from the Pool typically they should narrate how their character's actions are inspired, inspiring or heroic.

* **Advantage/Disadvantage:**
Must be declared before any creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. That creature then rolls with Advantage or Disadvantage at the player's choosing.
* **Reroll:**
You may reroll any one dice roll you just made. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse.
* **Act Out of Turn:**
Take your turn immediately (i.e. out of initiative order). Treat this as a readied action, moving your initiative for this round to just before the currently acting creature.
* **Stunt:**
Player may modify an action by declaring that action a Stunt. Must be declared before the attempt is made, and the inspiration is spent regardless of if the attempt succeeds or not. For example, sprinting an extra 10 feet in a direction, extending the range of a spell a small amount, or specifically targeting an enemies weak point, etc. If used as part of an Attack action, if the attack hits, in addition to the normal effects, you may also cause an additional effect, such as: blinding, deafening, moving a creature up to 5 feet in a direction, knocking a creature prone, disarming, cleaving, kicking, tumbling, or more. Only one additional effect may be applied per Stunt, but multiple Stunts may be applied to a single action. Final effects, including duration of status conditions, are at the DM's discretion. If the stunt turns out to be a particularly spectacular success (because of favorable dice rolls) the DM may choose refund one Inspiration point. TODO: make an appendix with stunt suggestions, including this reference: https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/203-fighting-dirty-cinematic-combat-stunts
* **Revelation (2+ Inspiration):**
If you feel stuck at one point in the adventure, you can spend 2 Inspiration (or more, DM's fiat) and petition the DM for a hint about what to do next. If the DM feels that there is no information to be gained, the Inspiration can be fully or partially refunded.
* **Extra Action (3 Inspiration):**
Gain an additional Move, Action, Bonus Action, Interaction, or Reaction this turn.
* **Remove Exhaustion (4 Inspiration):**
You may remove one level of Exhaustion from a character.
* **Cheat Death (5+ Inspiration):**
How this plays out is up to the DM, but generally the character is left alive, with 1 hit point, Unconscious, but stable. For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends the required Inspiration points, the DM decides that the arrow pierced the character’s holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. The character can spend Inspiration points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC.
* **Recall (Spell-Levelx2 Inspiration):**
You may recall a spell you have already cast at the cost of 2 Inspiration for every spell level. 1st spells cost 2 Inspiration to recall, 2nd cost 4 Inspiration, and so forth up to 9th level spells costing 18 Inspiration to recall. Additionally, Recall can be used to gain another use of a special ability that is otherwise limited. This should only be used on feats and abilities possessed by your character that recharge on a daily basis. The DM will determine the approximate equivalent spell level for the ability so Inspiration cost can be calculated.
* **Special (Inspiration costs varies):**
You can petition the DM to attempt nearly anything that would normally be almost impossible. Such uses are not guaranteed and should be considered carefully by the DM. Possibilities include casting a single spell that is one level higher than you could normally cast (or a 1st-level spell if you are not a spell-caster), making an attack that blinds a foe or bypasses its damage reduction entirely, or attempting to use Diplomacy to convince a raging dragon to give up its attack. Regardless of the desired action, the attempt should be accompanied by a difficult check or penalty on the attack roll. No additional attempts may be made for such a special action by the character or his allies regardless of the amount of Inspiration points available, and the cost is determined by the DM.

# Dynamic Initiative

Dynamic Initiative is an initiative variant with the goal of creating extra layers of choice in combat by making different actions take different speeds, and at the same time being as quick and painless a system as possible.

## Rules

The Dynamic initiative variant institutes the following rules, which replace the standard initiative system.

### Overview

#### Variable Turn Order

Each round a new initiative is rolled for every creature involved in the battle. Thus, order in which creatures take their turns changes from round to round, making it impossible to predict how events in combat will unfold.

#### Initiative Dice

The d20 is no longer generally used to roll for initiative.

##### PC Initiative

PCs refer to the Dynamic Initiative dice chart to determine which die or dice you should use for Initiative. If you roll more than one initiative die, you add the results together to determine your initiative. The number and type of initiative dice you roll depend on the types of activities you want your character to undertake during the next round.

##### Monster Initiative

The DM will use the creature Hit Die size as the Initiative die. No matter the action the creature is going to take, they simply roll that one die. Intuitively, this means that the bigger and more powerful the monster, the slower they tend to act in Initiative. The DM should make adjustments as desired (zombies should probably have a negative modifier, a Coatul should get a bonus) and you're done.

#### Initiative Count

With this variant Dynamic Initiative, initiative runs from low to high, with the best initiative score being a 1.

#### Tie Breakers

The creature with the higher Dexterity Ability Score (NOT their Ability Score Modifier) gets to choose whether to go before or after the other creature(s) it tied with. In the event that the Dexterity Scores are also tied, the creatures act simultaneously.

\columnbreak

#### Durations

Any effect that normally lasts until the end of a creature's turn instead lasts until the end of the round during which that turn takes place. Similarly, any effect that normally lasts until the start of a creature's turn now lasts until the start of the round during which that turn takes place. (This rule avoids situations where a spell that lasts until the next turn cast at the end of round one, only lasting until the beginning of round two, and having the spell end before the benefits were reaped.)

### Initiative Modifiers

#### Dexterity

Dexterity no longer modifies the initiative roll. The Bard's _Jack of all Trades_ ability also no longer affects initiative rolls. The _Alert_ feat allows you to roll your initiative dice with Advantage.

#### Bonuses or Penalties

Though this system does not apply a creature’s Dexterity modifier to its initiative rolls, other effects can alter initiative. If an effect grants you a bonus to your initiative, such as the Alert feat, reduce the size of one die you roll for initiative by one size, so that a d6 becomes a d4, a d4 becomes a d3, and so on. In the case of a penalty to your initiative, you apply the reverse process, increasing the size of one die rolled instead.

#### Advantage or Disadvantage

If an effect would grant you advantage or disadvantage on your initiative roll under the standard system, you apply that to the largest initiative die you roll (or to one of those initiative dice if you roll more than one of the same type). Roll the initiative die twice, using the lowest roll if you have advantage or the highest roll if you have disadvantage.

#### Surprise

A surprised creature adds +10 to its initiative result and cannot take Reactions while it is surprised. A creature is surprised until the end of the round during which it is surprised.

\pagebreakNum



### Other Rules

#### Creatures Unable to Act

Any creature that is unable to take actions (most likely because it is incapacitated) does not roll initiative. Any effects that such creatures must resolve, such as death saving throws, are resolved at the end of the round.

#### Delaying

You cannot use the _Ready Action_ under these rules, but you can instead choose to delay your turn. Instead of taking your turn on your initiative count, you simply act on a later initiative count, before or after other creatures actin later than you as you choose.

#### Multiple Actions

If an effect grants you an additional action without the use of a bonus action (like Fighter's Action Surge), choose which action you will perform first, and then roll the appropriate initiative dice for each of your chosen actions except apply a +10 to the second action's initiative roll. The creature will perform each action on the appropriate initiative count.

#### Changing your Action

If your turn comes around and you discover that the battlefield has changed, you may wish to take a different action. Roll new Initiative Dice in accordance to what you want to do. This number is then added to your current Initiative Score, and becomes your new Initiative Score.

\columnbreak

#### Actions not contributing to Initiative

If you are *only* moving during your turn, and not taking any other Actions, your initiative score is 1. **Bonus Action** and **Reaction** do not contribute to Initiative Score.

#### Optional: Spell Disruption
 
For added AD&D flavor, you can introduce the spell disruption rule. This variant rule greatly reduces the effectiveness of all casters, so use with caution.

If a creature that wants to cast a spell takes damage during the round before it can act, it must make a Constitution Check. Make a Constitution saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage it takes, whichever number is higher. On a failure, the creature is restricted to casting cantrips on its turn.

If it takes damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, it must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

# Dynamic Initiative: Lifecycle
___
Each round consists of the following phases that are progressed through in the following order.

### Enemy Indication Phase

During this phase, the DM examines the battlefield and **indicates the apparent intent of the creatures** under his control. This description should be brief and dramatic, "The gaping skeletons all turn their silent attention on the Warlock," or "The devious dragon looks like he's going to ignore the party and attack the church," or "The bandits are shifting as if to try to block your escape, while the archers continue to pepper you from out of range," etc.

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** This is not meant to be a free Insight check, rather it presents a stage in each round that prompts the DM to create drama and intensity. It is a catalyst for narrative flavor to dovetail into the midst of D&D's Combat game play. "With rage blazing in his eyes the dragon draws a really deep breath," or "The knave looks around for an escape route, as if he's about to bolt," and thus hinting a possible transition to a chase scene. Here surprising twists can be revealed, or DM hints can be dropped (i.e. the party is in over their heads). It isn't that this couldn't otherwise be done, rather Enemy Indication is a gaming mechanic that allows the characters to make educated decisions during their planning phase. Ultimately it is about telling a story together.

</div>

### Player Planning Phase

Now that the players have a broad idea of what the enemy's indication is, they come up with a plan themselves, and **declare their own intentions**. At this stage, actions do not need any more detail than what is needed to determine the initiative roll. Working together is encouraged.

### Roll Initiative Phase

The players and the DM all **roll initiative**. Players roll the largest dice corresponding to their actions (see Dynamic Initiative chart for dice). The lower the number, the earlier the action.

### Resolve Actions Phase

Each creature **takes its turn** in order starting with the lowest initiative roll. The DM announces "Initiative Count 1" to the table and any creatures that rolled a 1 for their Initiative take their turn. After all creatures on Initiative Count 1 act, the DM continues counting, "Initiative Count 2", "Initiative Count 3", etc. This process continues until all creatures have acted.

### End Phase

Anything that needs to be **resolved at the end of a round** of combat including status effects or magic durations.

# Character Creation

## Character Additions
During the process of creating your character here are some additional items to do.

### Select an Additional Feat

Adventurers are exceptional specimens, and they have the talent to prove it. All characters may select one additional feat at first level.

### Advantage on HP rolls

Whenever you go up a level and are rolling for HPs, roll with advantage with your DM. (Depending on your results the DM may choose to give you another additional reroll.)

\columnbreak

### Optional: Ancestry
 
Players may choose an Ancestry for their characters. Functionally, this is almost identical to choosing a Race, with the distinction being largely conceptual.

By choosing an ancestry, you are not determining your parentage, but what racial, cultural and societal forces shaped you. A human raised by Dwarves may claim Dwarven ancestry, and a half-elf may choose to take Human, Elf, or Half-Elf ancestry, depending on what forces shaped them into the person they became.

***Ability Score Increases.*** As a result of this more flexible approach to race, all racial Ability Score Increases may be distributed to ability scores of your choice. For example, choosing a Half-Orc ancestry allows you to increase one ability score of your choice by 2, and one ability score by 1. These must be different ability scores.

## Personal Characteristics

### Standard

This is a review and summary of the standard Personality Characteristics.

* **Personality Traits** describe the things your character likes, past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude or mannerisms
* **Ideals** are things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system. What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?
* **Bonds** are character’s connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character’s motivations and goals. Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?
* **Flaws** are some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?

### Aspects

Aspects are additional Personality Characteristics that adds **detail, depth, and breadth** to a character. They can be additional Traits, Ideals, Bonds or Flaws, or something entirely different. They provide a resource to **spark player creativity** as they play their character and a foundation as they act in character. Mechanically they can be used by a player to make in game situations more potent or authentic to petition the DM for Inspiration. The more Aspects a character has the easier it will be to find one to invoke.

#### Creating Aspects

Aspects are a word or phrase that describes something **unusual or special** about a character. They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, titles you possess, madness and sanity, reputations you have, obligations to others, problems you're dealing with, goals you're working towards and more.

An Aspect is a phrase that defines a truth about a character. A good aspect should:
* **Clear:** Be worded so that it can be invoked
* **Compelling:** Reveal something interesting about the character, something they may not even know
* **Double-Edged:** Have elements that are potentially both positive and negative

Additional advice on creating an excellent Aspect can be found in the [FATE SRD](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/making-good-aspect "Making A Good Aspect").

\columnbreak

#### Gaining Aspects

Your character should pick up an additional Aspect about **once per level**, but there really is no limit. While core Aspects to your character may never change, other Aspects will be gained and lost as the game is played.

#### Example Aspects

TODO: Consider moving the list of example Aspects to an appendix.

## Character Depth

Be sure to go through _Chapter 4: Personality and Background_ of the PHB and flesh out your character. **This does not all need to be done before you begin playing**, but it should be done at some point early in your character's career. Be sure not to skip over anything. Determine your _Height and Weight_, and _Other Physical Characteristics_. Select an _Alignment_. Choose a _Background_ and _Personal Characteristics_.

### Additional Character Details

As you work on that, also consider the following elements of your character. In order to be truly effective **this should be written down** on your character sheet. Take time to do that. Feel free to make changes or adjustments to these character depth details as you go along so that they are more congruent (they compliment and enhance each other).

#### Personality Quirks

Personality Quirks are unusual characteristics, weird behaviors, or peculiar habits that add much flavor to a character and are meant to be mechanically benign. Give your character one to three Personality Quirks. Either choose or roll 1-3 times on the Personality Quirk Table (see table below), or you can choose to roll on this [DndSpeak Personality Quirks](http://dndspeak.com/2017/12/100-personality-quirks/ "100 Personality Quirks")  table, or make up your own personality quirk(s).

#### Character History

Tell your character's story. Here's some questions to get you started:
* What are the important details from your past?
* Where did you grow up or where are you from?
* What is your family like and who are the members of it?
* What relationships do you have and with whom?
* What was your occupation and/or hobby? What is your father's occupation?
* What are some of the interesting things that have happened to you in your life?
* How did you discover your special powers (from your Class)?
* How did you obtain some of the skills and abilities you are proficient in?
* You got an extra feat, how did you learn that ability?
* What are the explanations of your Personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws?
* What are some of your past accomplishments?
* Who are people that have influenced you, or that you looked up to?
* Do you have a title, reputation, or position?
* What are some things that you dislike or that really bother you?
* What personal problems are you dealing with?
* Do you have other character flaws or shortcomings?
* What are your aspirations, dreams, or goals?

As you play this game some of the answers to these questions may change. Flesh them out as your character gains experiences and builds character. You may not have the details for some of the answers now, but as they come continue to write them down.

\columnbreak

#### Call to Adventure

Why are you an adventurer? Here are some ideas:
* Searching for someone or something:
   * Missing family member
   * Orphan looking for parents
   * A missing family heirloom
   * An artifact
   * Trying to figure out who you are
   * Understanding of why you have special powers
* Quest:
   * Destroy something evil
   * Performing a task for the king, chief, or leader
   * Solve a puzzle or mystery
   * Helping someone desperate or in need
   * Uncovering an important piece of knowledge
* Revenge:
   * Recapture homeland
   * Hunt down a Big Bad Evil Guy
* Outcast or lost:
   * Amnesia
   * Slave
   * Refugee
* Other
   * Fulfilling your duty
   * Running away

___
What were the events that happened leading up to your character's Call to Adventure?

#### Party Connections

It is not necessary to find connections between the characters in the party, but doing so makes the game much more rich and meaningful. See if you can find ways your character is connected to the other characters in your group, and intertwining their backgrounds is even better.

#### Dynamic History

Remember to adjust and add to these details as you go on your adventure. Talk to the DM if you feel you need to make some changes so they better fit you and your character.
   
### Player Long-Term Goals

Think about what you, as the player, want to do with your character over a long period of time.
* What do you (the player) want to do with the character after completing the initial call to adventure?
* What do you want your character to be when he or she is 20th level?
* As a player, what are you trying to do in the world on a grand scale?

Examples: rule a dominion as king or emperor, create a major artifact, explore worlds beyond this world, become a demigod, discover lost magical secrets, destroy some great specific evil, get fabulously rich and retire, build a great city or empire



\pagebreakNum




## Optional: Pre-Levels

The concept of pre-levels is adding one or more character levels before level 1. In general, abilities and feats that a character class has at level 1, would then be divided among the pre-levels to generate a gradual progression leading up to level 1.

#### Choose a Race

Choose a race, but do not take any racial ability score adjustments.

#### Choose an Aptitude (Class)

Do not choose a class, you are a peasant. But do choose a Target Class, an aptitude, that you are working towards.

#### Determine Ability Scores

Roll ability scores in order (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha) by using the following formula: 8 + 1d4 - 1d4 (average 8). Alternatively you can roll 7 + 2d4 - 2d4 (average 7, but greater potential).

### Level Advancement

To advance from level A to B is 50 XP, from B to C is 100 XP, from C to D is 150 XP, and from D to level 1 is 200 XP.

<div class='classTable'>

##### Peasant Pre-Levels
| XP   | Pre-Level | HD  | Proficiency Bonus | New Features |
|:----:|:-----:|:---:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| -500 | A     | 1d4 | +0  | none |
| -450 | B     | 2d4 | +0  | 1 Class Skill, and 1 Class Weapon or Cantrip |
| -350 | C     | 3d4 | +1  | 1 Class Saving Throw, and 1 Class Armor or Tool |
| -200 | D     | 4d4 | +1  | 1 Class Feature (from 1st level) |

</div>

#### Hit Points

Roll a d4 for each pre-level, but do not add (or subtract) CON.

#### At 1st Level:

Once you advance through the pre-levels move on to 1st level.

* **Keep pre-level HPs:** Do not take max HPs for level 1, rather roll your class's HD die normally adding CON and then add this sum onto your pre-level HPs.
* **Background target:** Choose a background that you would like to work towards, but do not take any of the mechanical features. You will work on the Background features during your downtime. The DM will facilitate the skills, proficiencies, and equipment you receive from this.
* **Racial Ability Scores:** Take your race's Ability Score Increases.

As you continue advance through levels **do not** take any Ability Score Improvements as indicated on the Class Table. These will be facilitated generously by the DM during game play.

Pre-levels will never count towards any features or abilities that use levels as part of the calculation.

### DM Notes

* **Fragile:** During Pre-Levels, make sure the players aware that their characters are very fragile, one successful attack against them could be the end. Player creativity and ingenuity should be top priorities for encounters, and running away is usually a good option.
* **HD:** Pre-level characters can use their HD to heal (like normal). The DM can decide if Pre-level HD are kept once a character gets to 1st level (not recommended).
* **Background Proficiencies:** Have the characters "earn" the mechanical features from the Background they chose, as a part of downtime activities. They should probably have all of these by level 2 or 3.
* **ASI:** During Pre-Levels, look for every opportunity to pass out ability score increases. Any natural 20 should be an ASI of the associated ability **during game play**. Successful skill checks that were either creative or entertaining should also be strong candidates for an ASI. Create as many opportunities as possible for non-lethal dice rolls. (See Appendix C for examples.)
* **Career ASI:** ASIs are no longer part of the normal character level advancement. The DM should continue to look for opportunities to pass out ASIs during game play throughout the character's **entire career**. Characters should earn about 3 ASIs per pre-level and per normal level through level 5, and then about 2 per level after that. The DM can choose to give any ASIs upon any character level advancement.

#### Guideline for ASI

| Level | ~ Ability Scores Total<sup>*</sup> | ~ ASI During Level |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| A     | 48 | 3 |
| B     | 51 | 3 |
| C     | 54 | 3 |
| 1     | 57 | 3 |
| 2     | 60 | 3 |
| 4     | 66 | 3 |
| 6     | 72 | 2 |
| 8     | 76 | 2 |
| 10    | 80 | 2 |
| 15    | 90 | 2 |
| 20    | 100 | 2 |

\* The sum of the six ability scores

| 22 | You believe in love at first sight, and practice what you preach! You become instantly enamored with the first attractive person you see in a town. |
| 23 | No matter how savvy you are, you can never tell when (roll 1d4): 1. someone you aren’t into is hitting on you; 2. someone rejects you politely without firmly saying no; 3. someone compliments you to be polite; 4. someone tries to change the subject of off embarrassment rather than dishonesty. |
| 24 | You always “correct” people about the pronunciation of spells and anything related to arcana, always putting the emphasis on the wrong syllable. For example saying “Maygeek mysle” instead of magic missile. |
| 25 | You try to fit in with other races by trying to uses their terminology and accents as well as believing in the stereotypes given to that race which just makes you come off as condescending and racist. |
| 26 | The more people there are, the more quiet you are. |
| 27 | You get extremely defensive when someone disagrees with you. |
| 28 | You panic when you are suddenly put into the spotlight. |
| 29 | You just can’t stop talking about your preferences. You always have to give your opinion, even to strangers. |
| 30 | You can’t remember people’s faces well. |
| 31 | You don’t have a censor, and always let people know exactly what you think. |
| 32 | If some says any number lower than 8, your must pass a willpower check or keep counting to 8. |
| 33 | You are very modest, and must cover everything but your head whenever possible. If someone were to see you without sleeves you would blush. If someone saw you shirtless you would be uncontrollably stuttering, and so on with levels of embarrassment. |
| 34 | If you see a hairy mammal that is not trying to kill you, you are obligated to try to pet it, even if it is an NPC/PC. |
| 35 | Any race smaller than you, you treat as cute. You talk to it as though it were a small pet or baby, (even goblins). |
| 36 | You get drunk and start talking in a language other than common. Usually it is just gibberish and people who actually speak the language are offended. |
| 37 | If there is no light or you are unable to see, while you are not sleeping. You pee yourself. |
| 38 | You know 100 dad jokes and always say one if no one is talking or there is an awkward silence. |
| 39 | You are very bad at eating with utensils. If you use a fork, you must pass a test, (GMs choice) or stab your tounge. |
| 40 | You sneeze whenever someone says your name. |
| 41 | You forget people’s names. Whenever talking to someone you must pass an int check or say the wrong name. Once you get it right without being reminded you remember the name of that person. |
| 42 | You hate sand, because it’s course and rough and it gets everywhere. |
| 43 | You’re extremely conscious of proper posture. You’re constantly standing or sitting up straight. |
| 44 | You have a huge smile that never reaches your eyes. |
| 45 | You’re constantly humming a tune, not always the same one. It’s very soft and most of the time you don’t even know you’re doing it. If asked, you will say the tune is from a particular song, but anyone who makes a DC 15 History check will know it’s not the tune from that song at all. |
| 46 | While not knowing much of your deity, you still heavily worship them. You often with confidence misquote from scripture, or make up a quote in your head. |
| 47 | You don’t feel comfortable unless you’re chewing on something. If you’re not eating there has to be a toothpick, stem of grass, piece of straw or a pipe in your mouth. |
| 48 | You can’t abide having a wrinkle in your socks. If there’s something off about them you can’t concentrate on anything until you’ve taken your boots off and corrected it. |
| 49 | You give nicknames to everyone and everything. How flattering they are depends on how you think of the person or object. |

| 70 | You are absolutely sure everyone taller than you is on stilts. You eyeball their legs and sometimes attempt to prove this fact. |

| 72 | You absolutely REFUSE to sleep without a trinket of some kind. (a blanket, a stuffed animal, a pillow, etc.) |
| 73 | When you see a child’s toy, you must pass a Wis 10 save or you must play with it. You’re a child at heart and kids always make you smile. |

| 75 | You believe that food must have an excessive amount of spices in it…more than anybody else appreciates. You also insist on cooking. |

# DM Notes

Always remember that the Dungeon Master has absolute power.

## Guidelines for Play

#### Embrace Aspects

Aspects are arguably the single most important change these rules make. Taking the nebulous nature of ideals, bonds, and flaws and making them stronger, tangible, and more flexible, aspects create a wildly different reward structure for role-playing. With no limit to the number of aspects a single character can have, it not only allows players to inhabit characters that are multidimensional and flawed, but rewards them for it. Players who act in character not only have more fun and contribute more to the story, they make the entire party mechanically stronger.

#### Slow down the pace

Give your players plenty of downtime between adventures, and allow that downtime to become as much a part of the world and the story as adventuring. Downtime is where the world reacts to the way characters have changed.

#### Travel is Dangerous

When characters take a long rest while out in the wilderness it often should get disrupted because the world is dangerous. This can make long journeys tense, and a real drain on resources. Consider making perilous journeys part of your game.

\columnbreak

#### Player Housekeeping

There are several housekeeping tasks that a DM normally handles that actually could be delegated to players during a play session. The DM should do this and can reward players for helping by giving favors for doing the following tasks:

* Tracking initiative
* Playing the ambiance music
* Recording treasure
* Scribing names, places, and clues that need to be remembered
* Recording the play session sometime before the next session
* Collecting and redeeming Feature Cards
* Tracking game time or limited resources (food, ammo, etc.) if it is relevant to the current situation

A favor could be a discount when making a purchase, or a greater potential when rolling for down-time research successes. It could possibly be a redo or adjustment on a declared character action. A favor could be approximately equal to 1/3 of an Inspiration point.

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** If one or more of these Housekeeping items is important to you as the DM you can reward a player more handsomely for completing it. For example, recording the session could be rewarded with a full point of Inspiration.

## Sundry House Rules

### Entertainment = Bonus

Any time a player describes or role-plays what their character is doing in a way that is **entertaining** to everyone at the table, they get a **+1 bonus** to whatever dice they are rolling to do it.

### Critical Hits

Whenever a character scores a critical hit they do **maximum damage plus one extra** roll of the **damage dice**.

### Drinking Potions

**Potions** are small and can be quaffed as a **Bonus Action**. But administering a potion to another character is an action.

### Resting

#### Long Rest

As explained in the [Hit Dice](#hit-dice) rules, at the end of a long rest, a character **does not** automatically regain any lost hit points. During a long rest, a character can spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points. After a long rest, a character regains all spent Hit Dice.

#### Extended Rest

An extended rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 24 hours long, which can only be taken in a safe location, where characters have access to plentiful food, water, and comfort. An extended rest cannot be attempted while in the wilderness, while sleeping on dirt or stone, or while wearing armor. Characters must be in a location where they do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be on guard. Other downtime training and activities may be performed at the DM's discretion.

For each consecutive 24 hours of extended rest the character takes he can cumulatively add 1d12 to any healing. For example the first 24 hours the character gets 1d12 extra healing. The second consecutive 24 hours (so 48 hours of straight resting) they get 2d12 extra healing for that day (in addition to the 1d12 from the first day), and so forth.

\columnbreak

### Level Advancement Training

In order to advance a level a character must spend a extended period of downtime training. Level advancement can only be taken in a safe location, where characters have access to plentiful food, water, and comfort. Level advancement cannot be attempted while in the wilderness, while sleeping on dirt or stone, or while wearing armor. Characters must be in a location where they do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be on guard.

If a character cannot rest appropriately to level up they may still gain experience points. A character can only advance one level per downtime training.

Other downtime training and activities may be a part of the Level Advancement Downtime Training at the DM's discretion.

#### Time and Cost

The amount of time required is 48 hours per level the character desires to advance to. The cost for training materials and instruction is the level desired cubed (level³).

<div class='descriptive'>

**DM Note:** The DM may choose to allow the character the option of trading **double the cost** for **half the time** or vice versa.

</div>

#### Success or Failure

When training time is completed and expenses are paid the player must roll to advance the level. The DC is 10 + the desired level. The character's proficiency and Class Ability Score modifier can be added to the roll. On a success the character advances the level. For each failure the character must train another day, pay another 10% of the costs, and then try again with an additional +1 modifier. Roll modifier bonuses are cumulative in the case of multiple failures.

> #### Level Advancement Summary
> - Must be in a **safe** location
> - Desired-level x 48 hr
> - Desired-level³ gp

## DM Tips

##### During the session:

* Frequently **compel characters to invoke Personal Characteristics** and give them Inspiration for doing so.
* Encourage the players be **clever** and/or creative.
* As often as possible describe additional **senses** besides sight (hearing, smell, taste, touch, and inner-feelings).
* Delegate **housekeeping tasks to players**
* Constantly **create interesting choices**, even menial ones, i.e. "From the descending stairs you smell a rank, musty odor and from the east corridor your torches are beginning to flicker from a slight breeze, which way do you go?"
* Frequently ask the **players describe** what happened, especially for extreme (1s or 20s, min or max) dice rolls.
* Look for opportunities to have characters **build character** and have them write it down. (Whenever there is more than one crit or fail in a row, this is an opportunity to start an aspect.)
* Often **narrate** enemy or player actions, again use the six senses (Matt Mercer).
* Do **cut scenes** where you tell the players (not the characters) what the bad guys are doing even though their characters realistically couldn’t know this. It makes for a great story (Matt Colville). This should _**never**_ be something that takes away player or character agency.

\columnbreak

##### Between sessions:

* Specifically ask a player to **record the session** and reward them for doing so
* **Record DM ideas** and notes from the session
* **Prepare spells and special abilities** for the first round or two of an upcoming battle

#### Optional: DM Buys Time

Whenever the DM has to take some time to look something up or figure something out, this is a good activity that will occupy players and add to the story.

* The DM picks a character time interval where something could happen, i.e. on the road, during the night, while searching the room, or after a battle cleaning weapons
* The DM writes down two negative things that could possibly happen during this time period
* As many players as would like to participate also write down one negative thing that could happen, and one positive thing that could happen, of approximate equal value, all must be approved by the DM
* The papers go into a hat and the DM draws one out when he is ready

# Appendix A: Glossary

___
* **ASI:** Ability Score Improvement. Any increase to an Ability Score of 1 or more points.
* **Bloodied:** When a creature reaches half its hit points or less it is in the Bloodied state. *Narratively this means that the creature has more than battle fatigue and superficial cuts and bruises, they are wounded in a way that is serious and their life blood is beginning to flow out.*
* **Broken:** When a creature reaches one quarter of its hit points or less it is in the Broken state. *Narratively this means that the creature has serious injuries, broken bones, and internal damage.*
* **Bruised:** When a creature reaches three quarters of its hit points or less it is in the Bruised state. *Narratively this means that the creature has cuts and bruises. The damage is mostly just fatigue from the strain of battle.*
* **DMG:** Dungeons Master's Guide.
* **Exploding:** Or Exploding Dice. This typically means that whenever the highest value on a die is rolled you can roll it again and sum the second result with the first. This continues indefinitely as long as the highest result continues to be rolled. Also worth noting is that a die can explode on any of its values, for example exploding on a 1, and thus rerolling and summing all consecutive results as long as they continue to be 1s. If the exploding value is not noted then by default it is the die's highest result that explodes.
* **HBR:** Home Brew Rules. This refers to home brew rules that are included in this document.
* **NPC:** Non-Player Character. A character that is typically controlled by the DM. Sometimes a player may control an NPC, but this a usually temporary. An NPC's inclusion in the party is almost never permanent.
* **PC:** Player Character, a player's character. A character that is owned, run, and controlled by a player.
* **PHB:** Player's Handbook.
* **RAW:** Rules As Written. This refers to the standard gameplay rules precisely as they were written.
