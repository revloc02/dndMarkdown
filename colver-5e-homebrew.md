##### Preamble

<div style='margin-top:300px;'></div>

# 

A Deeper Darkness is a rules compendium created with the goal of creating a more oppressive and gritty feeling in your D&D game. Using these rules, players should be pushed to the breaking point, while also being empowered to take control of their own fates. If the idea of giving the players lots of power to influence the game and narrative scares you, these rules are probably not suited to your tastes.

##### Epic 6

Epic 6 shifts the game into a lower-magic setting. But by giving the players numerous ways to break through the level 6 ceiling, it helps tailor the game what the players want. If they desire more power, they must seek it, and be willing to pay the price for it.

It also slows down the pace of the game to allow a less compressed timescale. An adventurer's career should be measured in months and years, not days and weeks.


##### On Death's Door

Empowers players to make combat more thrilling. By removing the unconscious state and replacing it with the option of fight or flight, players have more agency in battle.

##### Pool Inspiration

Inspiration changes from a simple reward offered at whim to a collaborative resource that is always dynamic. Using **aspects**, players are able to reward themselves for acting in character and pursuing their own goals. Using narrative control, both players and the DM are able to exert their will for how they think a scene should play out. And both players and DM are able to alter the battlefield in dynamic ways using advantage/disadvantage and stunts.

\columnbreak

##### Dynamic Initiative

A more streamlined interpretation of Greyhawk Initiative that emphasizes speed and simplicity. Dynamic Initiative makes the speed of your actions a consideration, and ensures the landscape of the battle is always changing.

##### Character Creation Options

These tweaks shift the focus of racial features from nature to nurture, and strive to acknowledge that how you are raised is as important as what you are. All characters are also given a feat at level 1, to make the game more dynamic and to help make the players more survivable in a dangerous world. Lastly, players choose aspects, which create a reward structure for roleplaying.

##### The End of the Road

Death is a difficult part of the game, but these rules help put players in the mindset that death is not only possible, but can be fun and dramatic. Players are encouraged to make a will to sort out their affairs, and their compatriots gain benefits from carrying out their last rites.

##### GM Notes

Extensive notes on thought process, as well as tips for using these rules in your games and clarifications on rules conflicts.

# Campaign World Setting

The world in which you play is

## Low Magic but Epic Fantasy

### Adventurers are Rare

Adventuring is not an occupation, rather it is a side effect of fulfilling a more pressing need—saving the town, completing the quest from the Duke, or finding the lost princess.

### Magic is Uncommon

Magic is...well, magical. Cantrips are fairly common, but anything above that becomes rare pretty quickly.

### Magic Items are Very Rare

### Class Levels are Uncommon

* Levels 1-3 are fairly common. Lots of folks across the land can level-up from training or defending theirs homes from time to time.
* Levels 4-6 are uncommon. Many of the leaders across the land are in this category.
* Levels 7-8 are rare. This consists of the greatest leaders.
* Levels 9-10 are very rare. Only the most powerful kings and great arch-mages are this level.
* Levels 10+ are only known in legends. Campaign humanoid NPCs with class levels will not exist in this category. PC adversaries will be monsters with a high CR.

A town militia would be run by a 1st or 2nd level Fighter and be full of peasants. City guards would be 3rd level max, with a Captain that is 3rd to 5th level. Renowned heroes or Kings would be 8th level, some would be as high as 10th level. The local wizard studying in his tower would be a 6th to 10th level character. Most people are just people and anyone who has some class levels it is usually or 1 to 3 levels.

### Epic levels are Very Rare

To use other fantasy stories as examples, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Conan the Barbarian, Geralt, Jamie Lannister are all approximately level 10 characters. Powerful, competent, and heroic, but not invincible. Without going through extraordinary means or making bargains with greater powers, level 10 represents your character at their most capable.

Epic 10 is suited to lower-magic and grittier campaign settings and worlds. "Low Fantasy" is a relative term - the Continent from the Witcher is probably the best point of reference.

The point of Epic 10 is not to limit the players, but to limit the world around them. Players are clever, ambitious, and always surprising. Players will find ways to circumvent any limitation or obstacle in front of them.

However, in an Epic 10 world, there is no magic higher than level 5. This means teleportation is limited, resurrection is much harder to find, advanced scrying is restricted, wishes are extremely rare, and many other powerful spells are unavailable through conventional means.

#### Higher Level Magic

Magic more powerful than level 5 spells are still possible and still exist in the world, but they are not utility magics that can be cast in seconds or minutes.

Frequently, it takes a coven of witches, a circle of druids, or an order of wizards weeks of planning, preparation and concentration to perform more powerful magics.

While these magics may be available to players, it is not quick, easy, or cheap. Commissioning a high-level spell is like embarking on a construction project, with all the complications that go with it.


#### Downtime

As a result of the slower resting, there is a greater emphasis on downtime. Players should be encouraged to establish a home base, carouse the city at night, and build connections in new locations.

#### Leveling Up

Players may hit a milestone or gain enough experience to reach the next level, however they only gain a level at the end of a Long Rest. This again increases the focus on downtime.

#### Feats, Boons, and Blessings

After reaching level 6, players may still reach milestones while adventuring. At the DM's discretion, in place of awarding further levels, they may grant additional Feats, Boons or Blessings. Players may also specifically train or go questing to specifically gain new Feats, Boons, or Blessings.

### Beyond Level 6

While the rules state that level 6 is the default level cap, that cap is not set in stone. Rules are made to be broken.

Fiction is full of stories of those who reached the peaks of human achievement and still wanted more. The Lich is the quintessential example. Faced with the fragility of mortality and the limitations of their own magical ability, the Lich goes to extreme measures to break those barriers that hold back those with weaker stomachs and fewer ambitions.

Great power awaits those who dare to seek it.



\pagebreakNum



#### Resting

Heroes can recover from injuries quickly, but not overnight. There are three types of rests.

***Breather.***
Taking a breather is a short period of downtime, at least 5 minutes long. During that time players may rest, slake their thirst or hunger, bandage a wound, or just meditate on the task ahead.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice after taking a breather, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

***Short Rest.***
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 10 minutes of walking, fighting, casting Spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a short rest, a character regains 1 Hit Die. A character can’t benefit from more than one short rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

***Long Rest.***
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 24 hours long. A long rest can only be taken in a safe location, where characters have access to plentiful food, water, and comfort. A long rest cannot be attempted while in the wilderness, while sleeping on dirt or stone, or while wearing armor. Characters must be in a location where they do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be on guard. 

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points, and regains all spent Hit Dice. A character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

#### Level Advancement Downtime Training

In order to advance a level a character must spend a extended period of downtime training. Level advancement can only be taken in a safe location, where characters have access to plentiful food, water, and comfort. Level advancement cannot be attempted while in the wilderness, while sleeping on dirt or stone, or while wearing armor. Characters must be in a location where they do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be on guard.

If a character cannot rest appropriately to level up they may still gain experience points. A character can only advance one level per downtime training.

Other downtime training and activities may be a part of the Level Advancement Downtime Training at the DM's discretion.

##### Time and Cost

The amount of time required is 24 hours per level the character desires to advance to. The cost for training materials and instruction is the level desired squared.

##### Success or Failure

Once the training is completed the player must roll to advance the level. The DC is 10 + the desired level. The character's proficiency and Class Ability Score modifier can be added to the roll. On a success the character advances the level. For each failure the character must train another day, pay another 10% of the costs, and then try again with an additional +1 modifier. Roll modifiers are cumulative.

# Dying

These rules replace Death Saving Throws. Falling unconscious and rolling one die every turn to see if the player will continue playing is actually not that fun. Allowing the character continued freedom to act and make interesting choices is engaging to the player, which are all three good things. This makes for a slightly grittier game, but not as unforgiving as 1e rules where 0 HPs means immediate death. These rules also add some realism without adding a lot of complexity.

___
> ##### Summary
> - Death Saving Throws are no longer used
> - **Drop to 0 HP:**
>   - Gain the **Dying** condition
>   - Concentration is broken
>   - +1 Exhaustion
> - **Dying** condition:
>   - **End of turn:** +1 Exhaustion
>   - **Suffer Damage:** +1 Exhaustion
>   - **Suffer Crit Hit:** +2 Exhaustion
>   - **Damage >= HP max:** instant death
> - **Regain HP:** **Dying** removed (Exhaustion remains)
> - **Stabilized:** actions to stabilize **restore 1 HP**
> - **First Aid:** Medicine check to stabilize any creature you can touch **DC = 10 + targets exhaustion level**

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a character drops to 0 hit points, he or she gains the **Dying** condition, concentration is broken, and they gain 1 level of Exhaustion. Note that the Instant Death (PHB, p. 197) rules still apply as per RAW when massive damage is taken.

## Dying Condition

_The Dying condition indicates a character is on their way to death and grants multiple rounds to either stop the death or go out with a bang. Urgency is created without removing the characters ability to do something about it. In combination with existing rules about removing level of exhaustion this creates a scenario where the closer a character gets to death the longer it takes for him to recover from the shock of that situation—potentially multiple days to remove all levels of Exhaustion. During that time the character will have some disadvantage on checks and reduced speed (as per the exhaustion levels) and this represents a bit of shell shock or PTSD being suffered by the character._

**Dying** is a special condition that simply means a creature has 0 hit points and is not dead yet. A creature obtains the **Dying** condition immediatly when they drop to 0 hit points and looses the condition as soon as they gain any hit points.

The **Dying** condition causes the creature to suffer **+1 Exhaustion** level 1) immediately, 2) at the end of their turn, 3) when they take damage.

**Dying** creatures are conscious. As such spells like _Sleep_ will still affect them. 

Exhaustion gained from **Dying** does not end when the **Dying** condition is lost unless the healing method specifically describes also removing levels of exhaustion. Exhaustion gained from **Dying** is like all other exhaustion. As per RAW if a creature gains the sixth level of exhaustion it is dead. See _Exhaustion_ in _Conditions_ (PHB p. 291) for complete information.

#### Falling Prone Instead

When the **Dying** condition imposes suffering **+1 Exhaustion** levels the player may choose that their character instead falls prone. This option is only available if the character has not already been prone this turn.

#### Damage while Dying.

If you take any damage while you are **Dying**, you suffer **+1 Exhaustion** level. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

#### Stabilizing a Dying Creature.

Effects that stabalize a **Dying** creature now do so by healing for one hit point. Stabalization via first aid can be done on any creature you can touch and requires a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check with a DC of 10 + targets exhaustion level.

Creatures that have been stabalized from **Dying** have been at deaths door. Thats a very traumatic situation. It may be appropriate to roll on the "Lingering Injuries Table" (DMG ch9) for the creature. 

#### A Note on Exhaustion Removal
Levels of Exhaustion can be removed in the following ways:

- Greater Restoration spell reduces the target's exhaustion level by one (RAW)
- Potion of Vitality: removes all exhaustion (RAW)
- Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by one, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink (RAW)
- You may spend two HD to reduce Exhaustion by one level (HBR)
- You may spend one Inspiration to reduce Exhaustion by one level (HBR)

# H-Dice

    in order for this to work you need to be pushing for 6-8 encounters between long rests.
    also worth noting is the existing rule that state characters can only benefit from 1 long rest every 24 hours

> #### Goals:
> - give more uses for Hit Dice, staying on brand
> - prevent a full character reset during long rest
> - provide collaboration, interesting player choice

A character already has a pool of Hit Point Dice (Hit Dice or HD) that represents general vitality. The amount and size of the dice is determined by the class levels the character has progressed to. The PHB describes a mechanic in which a character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest to regain hit points. This represents a character being rejuvenated from a rest. The sections below clarify some points on Hit Die and provide more ways to use them that are centered around vitality, endurance, and stress.

> #### Summary:
> - Spending HD is 1HD+CON (exploding)
> - After long rest characters no longer get full heal
> - After long rest characters regain all spent HD
> - After short or long rest spend HD to regain hit points, repeated as needed on same creature
> - Use a Reaction to spend HD for bonus to as attack, save, or check
> - Can spend HD to assist another creature


## Spending a Hit Die

As is described in the PHB, Each Hit Die in the characters pool is either available or spent. To spend a Hit Die roll a characters available Hit Die and add their Constitution modifier. This total number will be applied to the purpose of spending the die. This Hit Die is now considered spent.

## Resting Up

At the end of a long rest, a character **does not** automatically regain any lost hit points. At the end of a short or long rest, a character can spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points. After a long rest, a character regains all spent Hit Dice.

Removing a full character health reset introduces more grit into the game. Characters should consider the lasting consequences of their decisions instead of mearly surviving the day. Thus the Hit Dice at the beginning of the day represent all the natural healing and vitality for the entire day regardless of the length of the rest.

_**Example:** Wendy is a level 5 Wizard. She has a total of 5d6 Hit Dice. Currently they are all available. The party just survived a few encounters, in which she got a bit beat up, and is now taking a short rest. Alice is spending the time bandaging wounds. At the end of the short rest she spends a Hit Die (1HD+CON) to regain hit points. It was a low roll so she decides to spend another. Much better. After regaining the hit points she is feeling more confident for the next encounter. Wendy now has two spent hit dice and three available hit dice. If all goes well in the next encounter she plans to spend the final three Hit Dice after her long rest._

## Push Yourself

You can use your Reaction to Push Yourself. Spend a Hit Die to grant a bonus to an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check possibly turning a failure into a success.

You are pushing your character's limits thus incurring some stress to vitality. The added stress limits your ability to quickly be rejuvenated later.

_**Example:** Bob the Barbarian is in front line combat against a hoard of lizard folk. Bob uses Action Surge for more attacks in an attempt to finally defeat the lizard king. On his last blow Bob rolls a 2. Sure that he was a single hit away from victory he decides to use his Reaction to push himself. He spends a Hit Die (1HD+CON) getting 13 which he adds to the attack roll making it 15 total. A hit! The lizard king in fact is defeated and the other lizard folk run away on their turn. Bob is unable to take attacks of opportunity on them this round because his Reaction was spent, and it was worth it._

## Assisting your Allys

In an attempt to encourage group collaboration, reliance, and planning you can spend Hit Dice to assist any other creature. When spending Hit Dice to regain hit points during a rest you may only benefit a single creature that your character can touch for some time. Activities of this nature may include applying pressure, wrapping wounds, removing a spear head from their buttock, or a good pep talk.

This assistance includes Pushing Yourself to assist others during encounters. 

This turns all the individual Hit Dice pools into one large party pool that the players can plan around. 

_**Example:** Carla is a Cleric in a bad spot. The red wizard just threw a fireball at her and Frank the Fighter. If she does not succeed at this saving throw she may drop to 0 hit points which would be bad for the entire party. She rolled very low. A Cleric Hit Die is 1d8 and Carla's Constitution modifier is +1. A Fighter Hit Die is 1d10 and Franks Constitution modifier is +3. Frank knows that he has a greater chance of helping Carla and he happens to still have his Reaction available. He Pushes Himself using his Reaction to spend a Hit Die granting Carla a bonus to her Dexterity save. It worked, she made her save and only took half of the damage. In narrative, as the fireball comes crashing down Frank covers Carla shielding her from much of the blast. Its now Franks turn and he uses his Bonus Action to use Second Wind. Everybody is going to make it._

_In another example, Pat the Paladin recently fell into a pit of lava. At the end of the parties long rest Pat spent his last two Hit Dice but the healing came out pretty low. Pat is very concerned about the hag they need to visit tomorrow and he doesn't want to be low on health._

## Invigoration

Occasionally while dipping into your vitality you will experience a surge of invigoration. When you roll the maximum value while spending a Hit Die you can immediately remove 1 level of exhaustion from yourself.

# Pool Inspiration

Using these rules, Inspiration is a resource shared between the characters of the party. Inspiration is awarded to a player or character as per RAW, but the point of Inspiration goes into a party Pool of Inspiration that can be used by all of the players whenever they want. This encourages the party to work together as a team. Ideally Inspiration points in the pool should be represented by some physical object such as poker chips, tokens, or counter beads, and kept where all can view and utilize the pool.

The limit as to how much Inspiration can be in the pool is up to the DM. A rough rule of thumb could be 2 or 3 times the number of characters in the party.

___
> ##### Summary
> Inspiration is a resource shared by the entire party, and the pool of Inspiration can hold several points of Inspiration.

## Spending Inspiration

When a player spends Inspiration from the Pool typically they should narrate how their character's actions are inspired or inspiring.

* ***Advantage/Disadvantage:***
Must be declared before any creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. That creature then rolls with Advantage or Disadvantage at the bidder's choosing.
* ***Act Out of Turn:*** Take your turn immediately. Treat this as a readied action, moving your initiative to just before the currently acting creature.
* ***Extra Action:***
On your turn to gain an additional Move, Action, Bonus Action, Interaction, or Reaction this turn.
* ***Recall:***
You may recall a spell you have already cast or to gain another use of a special ability that is otherwise limited. This should only be used on spells and abilities possessed by your character that recharge on a daily basis.
* ***Reroll:***
You may reroll any one d20 roll you just made. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse.
* ***Remove Exhaustion***
You may remove one level of Exhaustion from a character.

\columnbreak

* ***Revelation:***
If you feel stuck at one point in the adventure, you can spend a hero point and petition the GM for a hint about what to do next. If the GM feels that there is no information to be gained, the hero point is not spent.
* ***Stunt (2 Inspiration).***
Player may modify an action by declaring that action a Stunt. Must be declared before the attempt is made, and the inspiration is spent regardless of if the attempt succeeds or not. For example, sprinting an extra 10 feet in a direction, extending the range of a spell a small amount, or specifically targeting an enemies weak point, etc. If used as part of an Attack action, if the attack hits, in addition to the normal effects, you may also cause an additional effect, such as blinding, deafening, moving a creature up to 5 feet in a direction, knocking a creature prone, or more. Only one additional effect may be applied per Stunt, but multiple Stunts may be applied to a single action. Final effects, including duration of status conditions, are at the DM's discretion. If the stunt turns out to be a particularly spectacular success (because of dice rolls) the DM may choose refund one Inspiration point.
* ***Cheat Death (2 Inspiration):***
How this plays out is up to the DM, but generally the character is left alive, with 1 hit point, Unconscious, but stable. For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends 2 Inspiration points, the DM decides that the arrow pierced the character’s holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. The character can spend Inspiration points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC.
* ***Special (Inspiration costs varies):***
You can petition the GM to attempt nearly anything that would normally be almost impossible. Such uses are not guaranteed and should be considered carefully by the DM. Possibilities include casting a single spell that is one level higher than you could normally cast (or a 1st-level spell if you are not a spellcaster), making an attack that blinds a foe or bypasses its damage reduction entirely, or attempting to use Diplomacy to convince a raging dragon to give up its attack. Regardless of the desired action, the attempt should be accompanied by a difficult check or penalty on the attack roll. No additional attempts may be made for such a special action by the character or his allies regardless of the amount of Inspiration points available, and the cost is determined by the DM.

# Dynamic Initiative

Dynamic Initiative is an initiative variant with the goal of creating extra layers of choice in combat by making different actions take different speeds, while being as quick and painless as possible. The rules of Dynamic Initiative are meant to be intuitive and simple, but here are the specific details of how the rules function.

### Overview
The	Dynamic initiative variant institutes the following rules, which replace the standard initiative system.

***Variable Turn Order:*** Each round a new initiative is rolled for every creature involved in the battle. Thus, order in which creatures take their turns changes from round to round, making it impossible to predict how events in combat will unfold.

***Duration Rounds:*** Because combat order is variable from round to round, durations of spell effects and abilities are organized into rounds. Rather than effects ending during a specific creature’s turn, they last until the end of the round.

This rule avoids situations where a spell caster casts a spell, which lasts until their next turn, at the end of round one, and then rolling the best initiative for round two and having the spell end before the benefits were reaped.

***Dexterity:*** Dexterity no long modifies the initiative roll. The Bard's _Jack of all Trades_ ability also not long affects initiative rolls. The _Alert_ feat allows you to roll your initiative dice with Advantage.

***Initiative Dice:*** Rather than making a d20 roll for initiative, refer to the Dynamic Initiative dice chart to determine which die or dice you should use for Initiative. If you roll more than one initiative die, you add the results together to determine your initiative. The number and type of initiative dice you roll depend on the types of activities you want your character to undertake during the next round.

***Initiative Count:*** With this variant Dynamic Initiative, initiative runs from low to high, with the best initiative score being a 1. A creature cannot have an Initiative Score lower than 1.

***Tie Breakers:*** Each creature determines their new Passive Initiative score. Passive Initiative is equal to a creature's Dexterity Ability Score OR their Intelligence Ability Score (NOT their Ability Score Modifier). The creature with the higher Passive Initiative score gets to choose whether win the tie and act first. In the event that the Passive Initiative scores are also tied, the creatures act simultaneously.

### Changing Initiative

***Delaying.*** You cannot use the _Ready Action_ under these rules, but you can instead choose to delay your turn. Instead of taking your turn on your initiative count, you simply act on a later initiative count, before or after other creatures as you choose.

If two creatures who have delayed their actions both want to act at the same time, the creature with the highest Passive Initiative score get to choose who goes first.

***Changing your Action.*** If your turn comes around and you discover that the battlefield has changed, you may wish to take a different action. Roll new Initiative Dice in accordance to what you want to do. This number is then added to your current Initiative Score, and becomes your new Initiative Score.

### Actions that do not contribute to Initiative

These rules are designed so that players need only roll once to determine their Initiative scores, without additional modifiers. Therefore they only roll once, according to the action they are attempting to take with the largest size Initiative Dice. 

***Movement.*** Moving during your turn does not contribute to your Initiative Score. If you are *only* moving during your turn, and not taking any other Actions, your initiative score is 1.

***Bonus Action:*** Does not contribute to Initiative Score.

***Reaction:*** Does not contribute to Initiative Score.

<div style='margin-top:70px;'></div>

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### Variant: Spell Disruption
For added AD&D flavor, you can introduce the spell disruption rule. This variant rule greatly reduces the effectiveness of all casters, so use with caution.

If a creature that wants to cast a spell takes damage during the round before it can act, it must make a Constitution Check. Make a Constitution saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage it takes, whichever number is higher. On a failure, the creature is restricted to casting cantrips on its turn.

If it takes damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, it must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

# Dynamic Initiative: Lifecycle
___
Each round consists of the following phases that are progressed through in the following order.

### Enemy Planning Phase

During this phase, the DM examines the battlefield and indicates the apparent intent of the creatures under his control. This description should be brief, "The Skeletons are going to focus on taking out the Warlock," or "The Dragon is going to ignore the party and attack the church," or "The Bandits are going to try to block your escape, while the archers pepper you from out of range," or "The Rogue is looking to get out of danger, it's unclear what his intentions are," etc.

This models what the players are reading from the battlefield and their assessment of the current situation. This allows them to make educated decisions and have the opportunity to thwart the enemy's plans.

### Player Planning Phase

Now that the players have a broad idea of what the enemy is planning, they come up with a plan themselves, and declare their own intentions. At this stage, actions do not need any more detail than what is needed to determine the initiative roll. Working together is encouraged.

### Roll Initiative Phase

Each player and enemy simultaneously rolls initiative. Players roll the largest dice corresponding to their actions. Low numbers go first.

### Resolve Actions

The DM begins by announcing "Initiative Count 1" to the table. If there are any creatures that rolled a 1 for their Initiative are then able to act. If there are any ties, the creature with the highest Passive Initiative goes first.

After all creatures on Initiative Count 1 act, the DM continues counting, "Initiative Count 2", "Initiative Count 3", etc. This process continues until all creatures have acted.

### End Phase

Anything that needs to be resolved at the end of a round of combat, such as status effects or magic durations resolve now.

# Character Creation

## Character Additions
During the process of creating your character here are some additional items to do.

### Select an Additional Feat

Adventurers are exceptional specimens, and they have the talent to prove it. All characters may select one additional feat at character creation.

### Advantage on HP rolls

Whenever you go up a level and are rolling for HPs, roll with advantage with your DM. (Depending on your results the DM may choose to give you another additional reroll.)

### Optional: Ancestry
 
Players may choose an Ancestry for their characters. Functionally, this is almost identical to choosing a Race, with the distinction being largely conceptual.

By choosing an ancestry, you are not determining your parentage, but what racial, cultural and societal forces shaped you. A human raised by Dwarves may claim Dwarven ancestry, and a half-elf may choose to take Human, Elf, or Half-Elf ancestry, depending on what forces shaped them into the person they became.

***Ability Score Increases.*** As a result of this more flexible approach to race, all racial Ability Score Increases may be distributed to ability scores of your choice. For example, choosing a Half-Orc ancestry allows you to increase one ability score of your choice by 2, and one ability score by 1. These must be different ability scores.



\pagebreakNum




## Alternate: Pre-Levels

The concept of pre-levels is adding one or more character levels before level 1. In general abilities and resources that a character has at level one would then be divided among the pre-levels to attain a gradual progression.

### Choose a Race

Choose a race, but do not take any racial ability score adjustments.

### Choose an Aptitude

Do not choose a class, you are a peasant. But do choose a Target Class, an Aptitude, that you are working towards.

### Determine Ability Scores

Roll ability scores in order (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha) by using the following formula: 8 + 1d4 - 1d4 (average 8). Alternatively you can roll 7 + 2d4 - 2d4 (average 7, but greater potential).

<div class='classTable'>

##### Peasant Pre-Levels
| XP   | Pre-Level | HD  | Proficiency Bonus | New Features |
|:----:|:-----:|:---:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| -450 | A     | 1d4 | +0  | none |
| -400 | B     | 2d4 | +0  | 1 Class Skill, and Class Armor or Tool proficiency |
| -250 | C     | 3d4 | +1  | 1 Class Weapon or Cantrip, and 1 Class Saving Throw |

</div>

### Level Advancement

To advance from level A to B is 50 XP, from B to C is 150 XP, and from C to level 1 is 250 XP.

Once you advance through the pre-levels move on to 1st level.
At 1st Level:
* **Keep pre-level HPs:** Do not take max HPs for level 1, rather roll the dice normally plus CON and add on to pre-level HPs.
* **Background target:** Choose a background that you would like to work towards, but do not take any of the mechanical features. You will work on the Background features during your downtime. The DM will facilitate the skills and abilities you receive from this.
* **Racial Ability Scores:** Take your race's Ability Score Increases.

As you continue advance levels do not take any Ability Score Improvements . These will be facilitated generously by the DM during game play.

Pre-levels will never count towards any features or abilities that use levels as part of the calculation.

### DM Notes

* Make the players aware that their characters are very fragile, one successful attack against them could be the end. Running away, and player creativity and inginuity should be top prioities for encounters.
* Look for every opportunity to pass out ability score increases. Any natural 20 should be an ASI of the associated ability. Successful skill checks that were either creative or entertaining should also be strong candidates for an ASI.
* Create as many opportunities as possible for non-lethal dice rolls. Here are some examples:
   * Make a Dex (Sleight of Hand) check to steal some Dire Platypus eggs for food
   * Make a Int (History) check to see if anyone knows anything about the ruins of a razed settlement
   * Make a Cha (Intimidation) check to chase away the owlbear cubs
   * Make a Wis (Animal Handling) check to ride the horse
   * ...and so forth
* Have the characters "earn" the mechanical features from the Background they choose as a part of downtime activities. They should probably have all of these by level 3.
* Characters should earn about 3 ASIs per pre-level, and through level 6, and then about 2 per level after that. The DM can choose to give any ASI upon character level up.

##### Guideline for ASI 
| Level | Appox. Ability Score Total |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| A     | 48 |
| B     | 51 |
| C     | 54 |
| 1     | 57 |
| 2     | 60 |
| 3     | 63 |
| 4     | 66 |
| 5     | 69 |
| 6     | 72 |
| 10    | 80 |
| 15    | 90 |
| 20    | 100 |

## Describe Your Character

Be sure to go through _Chapter 4: Personality and Background_ of the PHB and flesh out your character. **This does not all need to be done before you begin playing**, but it should be done at some point early in your character's career. Be sure not to skip over anything. Determine your _Height and Weight_, and _Other Physical Characteristics_. Select an _Alignment_. Choose a _Background_ and _Personal Characteristics_.

> ##### Note About Alignment 
> Alignment is descriptive not prescriptive.

As you work on that, also consider the following elements of your character. In order to be truly effective **this should be written down** on your character sheet. Take time to do that.

### Personality Quirks

Personality Quirks add much flavor to a character and are meant to be mechanically benign. Give your character one to three Personality Quirks. Either choose or roll 1-3 times on the Personality Quirks Table, or make up your own personality quirk(s).

### Character History

Tell your character's story.
* What are the important details from your past?
* Where did you grow up or where are you from?
* What is your family like and who are the members of it?
* What relationships do you have and with whom?
* What was your occupation or your father's occupation?
* What are some of the interesting things that have happened to you in your life?
* How did you discover your special abilities (from your Class)?
* How did you obtain some of the skills and abilities you are proficient in?
* You got an extra feat, how did you learn that ability?
* What are the explanations of your Personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws?
* What are some of your past accomplishments?
* Who are people that have influenced you, or that you looked up to?
* Do you have a title, reputation, or position?
* What problems are you dealing with?
* What are your aspirations, dreams, or goals?

As you play this game some of the answers to these questions may change. Flesh them out as your character gains experiences and builds character. You may not have the details for some of the answers now, but as they come continue to write them down.

\columnbreak

### Call to Adventure
Why are you an adventurer? Here are some ideas:
* Searching for someone or something:
   * Missing family member
   * Orphan looking for parents
   * A missing family heirloom
   * An artifact
   * Trying to figure out who you are
   * Understanding of why you have special abilities
* Quest:
   * Destroy something evil
   * Performing a task for the king, chief, or leader
   * Solve a puzzle or mystery
   * Helping someone desperate or in need
   * Uncovering an important piece of knowledge
* Revenge:
   * Recapture homeland
   * Hunt down a Big Bad Evil Guy
* Outcast or lost:
   * Amnesia
   * Slave
   * Refugee
* Other
   * Fulfilling your duty
   * Running away

___
What were the events that happened leading up to your character's Call to Adventure?
   
### Player Long-Term Goals

Think about what you, as the player, want to do with your character over a long period of time.
* What do you (the player) want to do with the character after completing the initial call to adventure?
* What do you want your character to be when he or she is 20th level?
* As a player, what are you trying to do in the world on a grand scale?

Examples: rule a dominion as king or emperor, create a major artifact, explore worlds beyond this world, become a demigod, discover lost magical secrets, destroy some great specific evil, get fabulously rich and retire, build a great city or empire

# PART 4
##### GM Notes

</div>

<div style='margin-top:300px;'></div>

#

These rules taken in aggregate are intended to work together to create a specific type of game. Rules influence and shape behavior, and as a result work best when they are working in harmony with the DM's and the player's expectations.
#
## Guidelines for Play

#### Embrace Aspects

Aspects are arguably the single most important change these rules make. Taking the nebulous nature of ideals, bonds, and flaws and making them stronger, tangible, and more flexible, aspects create a wildly different reward structure for role-playing. With no limit to the number of aspects a single character can have, it not only allows players to inhabit characters that are multidimensional and flawed, but rewards them for it. Players who act in character not only have more fun and contribute more to the story, they make the entire party mechanically stronger.

#### Slow down the pace

Give your players plenty of downtime between adventures, and allow that downtime to become as much a part of the world and the story as adventuring. Downtime is where the world reacts to the way characters have changed.


#### Travel is Dangerous

Players are not able to take a long rest while out in the wilderness. This can make long journeys tense, and a real drain on resources. Consider making perilous journeys part of your game.

#### Scarcity 

Limitations can be fun. Consider introducing Healer's Kit Dependency, and being strict with encumbrance, resource management, light sources, and other mechanics to make your players feel like they need to battle for every inch of ground against the darkness.

#### Don't Hold Back

These rules are designed to put agency in the character's hands, and give them tools to bend their luck. As a result, present challenges worthy of them. As a DM, you are empowered to pit the characters against overwhelming odds. Make them sweat, make them bleed, and make their eventual triumph all the sweeter.

#### Kill your Darlings

Players are going to be able to ruin your beautiful plans in all kinds of new ways. They're players. It's what they do. Be loose, be flexible, and always respect their agency.

## Rapid Fire House Rules

#### Critial Hits

Whenever a character scores a critical hit they do maximum damage plus one extra die.

#### Drinking Potions

Potions are small and can be quaffed as a Bonus Action.

## DM Tips

During the session:
* Let the players be **clever** and/or creative.
* As often as possible describe additional **senses** besides sight (hearing, smell, taste, touch, and inner-feelings).
* Often **narrate** enemy or player actions, again use the six senses. (Matt Mercer)
* Frequently ask the **players describe** what happened, especially for extreme (1s or 20s, min or max) dice rolls.
* Do **cut scenes** where you tell the players (not the characters) what the bad guys are doing even though their characters realistically couldn’t know this. It makes for a great story. (Matt Colville)
* Constantly **create interesting choices**, even menial ones, i.e. "...from the decending stairs you smell a rank, musty odor and from the east corridor your torches are beginning to flicker from a slight breeze."
* Look for opportunity to have characters **build character** and have them write it down. (Whenever there is more than one crit or fail in a row, this is an opportunity to start an aspect.)

___
Between sessions:
* **Record the session**
* Prepare the first round or two of an upcoming battle


\pagebreakNum

# On Death's Door: Use in your game
The *Death's Door* variant rules are designed to allow the players to participate in combat after they drop to 0, and to feel the stress of 'Fight or Flight'. While players will actually be slightly more difficult to kill, it creates the feeling of just barely surviving deadly situations.

### NPCs and Death
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it  make death saving throws, which means most creatures are assumed to require 0 Death Points to perish. If a typical monster gains 1 Death Point by any means, they die.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them be on Death's Door and follow the same rules as player characters. At the DM's discretion, they may need to accumulate 1-4 Death Points before perishing. 

### Knocking a Creature Unconscious

If the attack would deal the final Death Point that would kill a creature, the attacker can declare the attack to be non-lethal and knock them out instead.

## Rules Conflicts

These rules by and large do not interfere with other systems and mechanics in the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. The very few exceptions I've found are listed below. 

### Dying and Stabilizing
These variant rules eliminate the concept of 'dying' and 'stabilizing'.

Mechanically speaking, in the vanilla rules the 'dying' status has always felt like a character has received a "Schodinger's Mortal Wound". They may or may not be actually dying, and a player who is holding in their guts needs only a Goodberry to be back in the fray. Not only that, but it's not fun as a player to have your turn skipped. 

### Healer's Kit
The Healer's Kit is intended to help stabilize dying players. This variant uses part of the Healer Feat to help make it useful, while keeping the idea of the medic patching someone up to get them out of harm's way.

> ##### Healer's Kit (Variant)
> This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit on a creature on Death's Door. That creature gains 1 Hit Point.

\columnbreak

### Healer Feat
The Healer Feat is intended to make Healing Kits more useful. This variant is based on [a blog post by Chris Perkins](https://scruffygrognard.wordpress.com/2015/05/25/fixing-the-medicine-skill-healers-kit-and-healer-feat-dd-5th-edition/comment-page-1/).
> ##### Healer (Variant)
> * You have advantage on all Wisdom (Medicine) checks.
> * When you use a healer’s kit on a creature On Death's Door, that creature also regains 1d6+4 hit points.
> * As an action, you can spend one use of a healer’s kit to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature’s maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can’t regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.

### Spare the Dying

The cantrip *Spare the Dying* is intended to help stabilize dying creatures. However, these variant rules eliminate the 'dying' condition.

The original spell is intended to let players help an ally who is already in a dire situation. This alternative is intended to keep the spirit of the original spell and keeping its balance, while working within the new framework. 

#### Rally the Dying
*Necromancy cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You boost the life spark of one creature you can see within range that is making a Death Saving Throw. That creature has Advantage on that Death Saving Throw.

### Rage Beyond Death
The Path of the Zealot Barbarian from Xanathar's Guide to Everything gains the Rage Beyond Death ability at 14th level. Here's how to adapt it to your game.

#### Rage Beyond Death
Beginning at 14th level, the divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you're raging, having 0 hit points and being on Death's Door does not give you three levels of temporary Exhaustion. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to accumulating Death Points, you don't die until your rage ends. If you end your rage with 1 or more Hit Points, remove one Death Point.

\pagebreakNum

# On Death's Door: Variant Rules
___
Listed below are a couple of variant rules that you might employ depending on the style of game you want to run.

## Death Points
___

How a player gets rid of Death Points makes a big difference in the way the threat that Death Points represent are viewed. Here are three simple tweaks you can make to better suit your game style. 

##### Variant: Lingering Injuries

You remove one Death Point at the end of a Long Rest.

##### Variant: Heroic

During a short rest, you may expend a Hit Die to remove one Death Point. All Death Points are removed at the end of a long rest.

##### Variant: Unstoppable

You remove all Death Points at the end of a Short or Long Rest.


## Optional Creature Attacks & Abilities

Certain creatures such as a Bodak, Catoblepas, Death Knight, or others may have abilities that give players Death Points.

This can be dramatic - imagine a Banshee's wail giving all players who hear it a Death Point as their heart skips a beat, threatening to stop in their chests. If you wish to give a monster an attack that inflicts Death Points, be careful not to make it disproportionately powerful. It should be considered approximately equivalent to granting a dangerous status effect or granting a level of Exhaustion, and should be treated with care not to make it too easy for an enemy to give a large number of Death Points in a short amount of time.

## Knocking Players Unconscious
___
>***Sandman.*** When this creature reduces a target to 0 hp, they may choose to knock their target unconscious.

This is a passive ability that should be used sparingly as it bypasses Death Points. Players being knocked unconscious is generally not fun and these rules exist to avoid that situation. However, I can understand the DM's desire to have a creature knock a player unconscious for dramatic purposes, to be kidnapped, or for other nefarious reasons. In such a situation, a DM may want to give a creature this ability. Consider however, that if you are using these rules and you want the ability to knock players unconscious, On Death's Door may not be a good fit for your table.

## Spell Variants

The following spell variants are recommended modifications, but not required for play.

### Greater Restoration

Greater Restoration is modified so that in addition to all it's previous effects, it is also able to remove death points. This is the only feature, aside from a *wish* spell that can remove death points during combat. However, if you've managed to get a 5th level spell slot, you've earned it.

#### Greater Restoration
*5th level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by one, remove one death point, or end one of the following effects on the target:

* One effect that charmed or petrified the target
* One curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic item
* Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores
*  One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum

### Revivify

Revivify is modified so that while it can bring the dead back from life, it's primary function is to heal a mortal wound. Subtle distinction, but for me it improves the flavor.

#### Revivify
*3rd level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that was mortally wounded within the last minute. That creature is healed, or returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

\pagebreakNum

# Pool Inspiration: Thought Process
___
## Inspirations
* **FATE**
* **Powered by the Apocalypse**
* **Noir World**
* **Blades in the Dark**

### FATE Points 

In the game FATE, there is a resource called [FATE Points](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/fate-point-economy "title"), which are the primary mechanical inspiration for these rules, though I do take a different approach to the point economy.

In FATE, there are four ways that FATE Points can be spent:

* **Invoke an Aspect**
* **Power a Stunt**
* **Refuse a Compel**
* **Declare a Story Detail**

I'll now outline the four ways that I have proposed for spending Inspiration Tokens, and how they should hopefully accomplish similar goals.

##### Advantage or Disadvantage

This one is the most simple and straightforward. In the base rules for 5e, Inspiration grants Advantage on a dice roll, so leaving that functionality intact seemed to be the most logical course of action. It also ties into Power a Stunt, and gives players and DMs the ability to bend luck in their favor.

##### Stunt

Ties into both "Invoke an Aspect" and "Power a Stunt", as well as the idea of the Called Shot. Stunts are a concept that I have long wished for in 5e, as the ability to have an attack go above and beyond the norm at a critical juncture is great drama for both players and DM.

I feel that every DM has been in a situation where the player has declared an amazing stunt where something other then just damage should occur. Picking up a foe and throwing them into another bad guy, ripping the arm off a skeleton, blinding a cyclops, etc. This then puts the DM in an awkward situation.

They can either follow the narrative of what the player does, or declare that the rules must be followed as written. Yes, a player can use a shove action to either push or knock down a foe, but that's just not the same and it lacks the drama of slamming an enemy through a wall.

This is further complicated by the very few enemies that have called shot mechanics built into them. The Hydra has special rules for cutting off a head, but it is the only enemy that you can target in such a way, and one of the only enemies that provides a path to victory other than "reduce to 0 hp".

I would argue that subclasses like the Battlemaster Figher, and the Sorcerer's Metamagic has been too selfish in the ability to meaningfully modify their attacks. These rules are not meant to render these abilities redundant, but to spread the love a bit. By giving this possibility to all classes (and all monsters!) , it makes the game more dynamic overall. 

##### Compel an Aspect

Lifted straight from FATE, but applied only to characters. The phrasing is left deliberately broad. It is meant to include not just ideals, bonds, and flaws, though those are the most obvious, but also backgrounds, madness and other sanity effects, cursed items, paladin oaths, warlock patrons, and more. It is not intended to give the DM the power to force players to do their bidding, but to encourage the parts of their characters that are already there. More then that, it also lets the players realize that they can ask the DM to invoke an aspect on themselves to gain a powerful resource by acting in character.

NPCs do not have Aspects, as there is not a lot of play space that would be opened up that was not covered by standard roleplaying, Charisma checks, and Narrative Control

For more great reference, check out the FATE SRD pages on [Your Character Idea](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea "Character Idea"), [Making a Good Aspect](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/making-good-aspect "Good Aspects"), and [The Phase Trio](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/phase-trio "Phase Trio")

##### Narrative Control

Functionally very similar to FATE's "Declare a Story Detail", as well as "Invoke an Aspect" this option provides everyone at the table the opportunity to direct where the game should go.

[Previously, I used a Inspiration Deck.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7dSqOD0xzM4OHozM3NDYmZPb0E/view?usp=sharing "Inspiration Deck") A big reason why it has been popular is the card "Narrative Control." While it's been successful with my players, as the DM I have often wished that I had a similar ability. It is true that the DM has control over the story, but it is extremely easy for the players to lose focus. While this is part of the fun, the most efficient path is not necessarily the most dramatic or the most fun.

By giving this tool to both the players AND the DM, it makes the story less about what happens at the table an more about what everyone *wants* to have happen at the table. In theory, this tool should help introduce an equilibrium to the narrative and help ensure that the game being played is the game that everyone *wants* to play.

### The Economy

The Inspiration Pool is my own twist on the FATE point system. The concept is simple: when you choose to exert your influence, you empower the other side to do the same back to you. While I considered more finite economies, the push and pull of this system is extremely appealing to me. Players know that while you're going to get yourself out of trouble *this time*, you're setting yourself up for more trouble in the future. And DMs can nudge the story in directions they want, knowing they are empowering their players to be even more heroic. It also removes the burden of adjudicating who earns inspiration from the DM.

### Conclusion

[I'm not the only one who finds Inspiration as presented by the game to be lackluster.](https://theangrygm.com/take-the-suck-out-of-inspiration/ "Angry GM - Take the Suck out of Inspiration") I also find all of my tabletop RPGs to be more satisfying when they allow the players to help shape the story. For me, these rules provide a simple way to introduce a lot of additional mechanical and narrative complexity to the game while adding very few actual rules.

# Dynamic Initiative: Thought Process 

Initiative never quite sat well with me. There are a number of fundamental assumptions that I dislike about Initiative as written, and in the way that it influences play. However, the Initiative variant rules outlined in the DMG (pg 270-271) were either unwieldy or reduced strategic possibilities. I wanted an option that offered depth, without complexity.

One of the biggest problems I have with vanilla Initiative is the feeling that a call for initiative is a switch from the "Role Playing Game" to the "Combat Game". Switching into and out of combat can be clunky and rigid. Players may be in the middle of a combat when a surprising twist happens. Perhaps the bad guy isn't a bad guy at all! Suddenly this combat turns into a hostage situation! The players realize they are in way over their head, it's time to run! In these situations, it can be hard to break initiative order - both as a psychological barrier (We are in the "Combat Game", we must resolve this situation with combat) and as a mechanical barrier (what is the mechanical process of transitioning from a combat to a chase scene?).

My initial solution to this problem was dividing combat into rounds, and introducing the "Planning Phase", where players as a team decided their combat strategy. This worked reasonably well, and was an overall improvement to the vanilla Initiative rules, and I would recommend giving it a try in your game if you haven't.

However it felt like it was a half measure. The players having a planning phase makes much more sense if the plan they have is informed. To put it another way, the rules don't allow for a situation where the bad guy is going to take an action, and the players can choose to either prevent him from acting or take cover to avoid damage.

Imagine a situation that we have seen a million times before in films. A dragon is drawing in a deep breath preparing to destroy the foolish mortals in front of him. The Heroes, knowing the deadly dragonfire is coming, scramble for cover. How can we translate this into gameplay?

### Greyhawk Initiative

Mike Mearls [Greyhawk Initiative](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UAGreyhawkInitiative.pdf "title") caused an interesting stir in the D&D community. 

The mission statement of the rules have been copied below.

 ##### Why Experiment with Initiative?
The Greyhawk initiative variant takes a different approach. These rules add complexity, but with the goal of introducing more drama to combat. The order of actions changes during combat, making it impossible to depend on creatures acting in a consistent pattern. Moreover, this initiative system requires a certain amount of strategizing between players ahead of each round’s action.

If adding chaos and unpredictability to combat sounds like fun, you might like these rules.

I love this mission statement, and feel it addresses many of my perceived flaws with vanilla initiative. However, the overall conclusion by the D&D community was that Greyhawk Initiative was interesting, but flawed. Some of the objections were:

* Slowed down play too much
* Too complicated
* Too much math
* Too many dice being rolled
* Rolling dice for movement felt bad
* Dexterity no longer impacted Initiative speed

Dynamic Initiative is my attempt to keep the strengths of Greyhawk Initiative, while removing its weaknesses.

Removing dice rolling for movement was an easy first step. Reducing the number of dice rolled to only one (two max) immediately makes the system much more simple and streamlined.

However, this created a narrow range of possible initiative numbers, meaning that having a tied initiative score became extremely common. But by having your Dexterity Ability Score become the tiebreaker, it provided a speedy way to resolve ties while also making Dexterity relevant to speed. From there, making the small change from Dexterity Ability Score to Passive Initiative also allowed features that can modify Initiative, such as the Alert feat, Guidance spell, or a Bard's Jack of All Trades to continue to function. Simply add those numbers to your Passive Initiative score.

### DMing with Dynamic Initiative

Making all of these strategic decisions as the Dungeon Master seems daunting. A DM already has so much to keep track of, remembering what action each creature is doing, combined with what die size to use seems overwhelming. Fortunately there is an incredibly simple workaround.

By using Hit Die size as a guide, it became extremely easy to assign Initiative Die by size of creature. No matter the action the creature is going to take, they simply roll that one die. Intuitively, this means that the bigger and more powerful the monster, the slower they tend to act in Initiative. Adjust Passive Initiative score as desired (zombies should probably have a negative modifier, a Coatul should get a bonus) and you're done.

For actually tracking each creature, I like to have an index card with each monster or group of monsters labeled with their name and Passive Initiative score. I roll the Initiative Die for the entire group, and leave the die on each label. At that point, I have the initiative of all my combatants easily readable at a glance.

### Conclusion

As evidenced by Mearls' Greyhawk Initiative, [I'm not the only one who feels that vanilla initiative is a bit boring and could have additional layers of strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOz35qLj_8c "title"). For me, this allows the maximum amount of strategy with the minimum amount of bookkeeping.
