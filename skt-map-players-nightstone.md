# Nightstone

Nightstone got its name from a massive chunk of obsidian that once stood in the middle of the village square. The obsidian megalith had strange glyphs carved into it and radiated magic under the scrutiny of detect magic spells, but its properties and purpose couldn’t be ascertained. The villagers assumed it was a relic of some bygone age or kingdom and left it alone.

## Travel

You’ve been traveling along the High Road for days. As evening approaches, you spot a wooden signpost next to a trail that heads north into the hills. Nailed to the post are three arrow-shaped signs. The two marked “Waterdeep” and “Daggerford” follow the High Road but point in opposite directions. The third, marked “Nightstone,” beckons you to follow the trail. If memory serves, Nightstone is roughly ten miles up the trail.

The oft used trail is easy enough follow. There is not nearly as much traffic here as there was on the High Road. In fact, you haven’t seen anyone until just now. Up ahead a merchant with a medium-sized wagon pulled by an ox is coming along. As you get closer you see he is nicely dressed but not extravagant, and ruddy and plump. His wagon is filled with various rolls of cloth for making clothes. As well as some of his personal effects. When you get within speaking distance he calls out to you in alarm, he’s even whimpering,  “Nightstone has been taken by goblins! Boo-hoo-hoo...”

## Arrival

After following the trail for ten miles, you hear the ringing of a bell. The sound grows louder as Nightstone comes into view. A river flows around all sides of the settlement, forming a moat. The village itself is contained within a wooden palisade, that is interrupted by several tall wooden watchtowers. It seems a most reputable place and you look forward to having a visit here.

South of the village and surrounded by the river moat is a cone-shaped, flat-topped hill on which stands a stately stone keep enclosed by a wooden wall. The keep, which overlooks the village, has partially collapsed, which seems very strange to you. A wooden bridge that once connected the keep to the village has also partially collapsed.

Beyond the wooden walls you see a windmill, a tall steeple, and the high-pitched rooftops of several other buildings. Apart from the ringing of the bell, you detect no other activity in the village. The trail ends before a lowered drawbridge that spans the moat. Beyond the drawbridge, two stone watchtowers flank an open gap in the palisade. It seems very strange that the drawbridge is lowered and there are no guards in sight.
