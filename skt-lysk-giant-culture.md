Annam All-Father was a giant deity and creator of the giant race in an ancient time very, very, long ago.

<div style='margin-left:160px'>

Annam came across the planet of Abeir-Toril at a time before the existence of dwarves, elves, and humans. He met and married Othea, who took the form of a mountain on the edge of the Cold Lands. They had children, Annam's first terrestrial children. His favorite sons all went on to form one of the true giant species, Lanaxis (titans), Vilmos (storm giants), Nicias (cloud giants), Masud (fire giants), Ottar (frost giants), Obadai (stone giants), Ruk (hill giants), and his two-headed son, Arno and Julian, went on to become ettin, meaning "runt".

Giant traditions held that Annam stopped the Thousand Year War, after having convinced the dragon god Garyx to settle the war with a game of wah-ree. So skilled were the two opponents that game ended in a stalemate, and the war came to an end.
### Ostoria

Ostoria (meaning "father's seat" in Jotun, an ancient giant language) was the original kingdom of the giants, founded by Annam All-Father to celebrate the last of his sons coming of age. At the peak of its power, it was dubbed "The Colossal Kingdom" because it occupied an area of Faer没n from the Vilhon Reach to the Cold Lands. As it grew, Annam split it up so that each of his favored sons could acquire part of it. The capital of Ostoria became a citadel built by Lanaxis called Voninheim.

When the dragons began posing a threat (see below), Ostoria went to war with them. This war would last over a thousand years, and Ostoria was reduced greatly when the end of the war came, restricted to the north of Faer没n.

Ostoria ceased to exist after the death of Ulutiu caused his amulet to freeze a large region of Faer没n's north (present-day Pelvuria), and the deaths of most of Annam's sons, despite Lanaxis's efforts to save the kingdom.

### Thousand Year War

The Thousand Year War was an ancient conflict between dragonkind and the giant nation of Ostoria, which lasted for...wait for it...1000 years. Actually it was a little more than a thousand, but that only matters to humans. Dragons and giants still feud even though the war ended several millenia ago.

#### Beginning

The war apparently began when the dragon god Garyx sent an avatar to lead a flight of red dragons to attack the giant nation. The reason for this attack is lost to history, especially to humans, elves and dwarves. Soon afterward, all races of dragonkind were involved in the conflict. The giants also created a powerful colossus construct called Vonindod to help them in the fight against the dragons. The battles acquired such an epic scope that they became the source of inspiration for many dwarven, elven, and even giant classical ballads.

#### Behirs

Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred for dragonkind. A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir's lair, the behir is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if the dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behir back down, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away.

Well, there is a rumor among the small folk that the story is very different. As the behir's color, shape and lighting breath can surely prove, the first behirs were not "created" by storm giants, but shaped by them from defeated blue dragons. Most dragons were simply slain for daring to resist the (superior) giant race, but blue dragons wielded lighting, and the storm giants could not forgive such a sin against their elements. First, their wings, arms and legs were ripped off, and then they were thrown, like agonizing worms, into claustrophobic tunnel-prisons, never to see the sun again, never to taste the freedom of the endless skies. Eventually, the dragons used their magic to grow small legs that would allow them to move and escape, but the predicament drove them mad. Turned into multi-legged abominations, behirs hide their shame deep into the earth, hating everyone and everything, especially well-formed dragons and the light of the sun. If you see a behir, it is unlikely to let you live.

### Giant Runes

There are legends of ancient runes of potent magical power. The lore says that the runes are from the culture of the giants, and that even creatures that have lived a very long time, even centuries, don't fully understand how to use this power. Most giants claim the runes are from ancient giant culture, but the meaning has been lost to time.

#### Giant Hero

One of the most renowned heroes of the war was Hjurnur Wyrmrever, an incredibly powerful frost giant, who killed many dragons single-handedly and was reputed to have challenged Tiamat in a contest of riddles. He lost that contest, however, and had to allow the Queen of Dragons devour his own child. Hjurnur died while killing a dragon king. His story was immortalized in the Saga of the Dragon Queller.

#### Decline of Ostoria

After more than a thousand years of warfare, Ostoria finally reached a truce with dragonkind. Accounts of the nature of the truce were conflicting because many races accounted the event differently. According to the dwarves, the dragons wanted to end the war with the giants because they were fighting in a violent civil war among themselves that led to the separation of the chromatic and metallic species. Giant traditions say that Annam All-Father and Garyx settled the war by playing a game of wah-ree, an ancient abstract strategy board game. The game ended in a stalemate, thus ending the war. After the end of the conflict, the giants dismantled the construct Vonindod.

#### Still Ancient Emenies

By the time the war concluded, Ostoria had been reduced to a shadow of its former self. On the day the truce was declared, the nation occupied only the northernmost edge of Faer没n, the areas now known as the Great Glacier, the Cold Lands, and the Savage North. Giants and dragons are still ancient enemies and are constantly on the lookout for any kind of treachery from the other. Even good giants and good dragons do not trust each other.
