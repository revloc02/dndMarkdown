### Annam All-Father

Annam All-Father was a giant deity and creator of the giant race. Annam came across the planet of Abeir-Toril at a time before the existence of dwarves, elves, and humans. He met and married Othea, who took the form of a mountain on the edge of the Cold Lands. They had children, Annam's first terrestrial children. His favorite sons were Lanaxis (titan), Masud (fire), Nicias (cloud), Obadai (stone), Ottar(frost), Ruk (hill), and Vilmos (storm), who all went on to form one of the main giant species, and his two-headed son, Arno and Julian, went on to become ettin, meaning "runt".

Giant traditions held that Annam stopped the Thousand Year War, after having convinced the dragon god Garyx to settle the war with a game of wah-ree. So skilled were the two opponents that game ended in a stalemate, and the war came to an end.

### Ostoria

Ostoria (meaning "father's seat" in Jotun) was the original kingdom of the giants, founded by Annam All-Father to celebrate the last of his sons coming of age. At the peak of its power, it was dubbed "The Colossal Kingdom" because it occupied an area of Faer没n from the Vilhon Reach to the Cold Lands. As it grew, Annam split it up so that each of his favored sons could acquire part of it. The capital of Ostoria became a citadel built by Lanaxis called Voninheim.

When the dragons began posing a threat, Ostoria went to war with them. This war would last over a thousand years, and Ostoria was reduced greatly when the end of the war came, restricted to the north of Faer没n.

Ostoria ceased to exist after the death of Ulutiu caused his amulet to freeze a large region of Faer没n's north (present-day Pelvuria), and the deaths of most of Annam's sons, despite Lanaxis's efforts to save the kingdom.

### Thousand Year War

The Thousand Year War was a conflict between dragonkind and the giant nation of Ostoria. 

The war apparently began when the dragon god Garyx sent an avatar to lead a flight of red dragons to attack the giant nation. Humans, elves and dwarves do not know why. Soon afterward, all races of dragonkind were involved in the conflict. The giants also created a powerful colossus construct called Vonindod to help them in the fight against the dragons. The battles acquired such an epic scope that they became the source of inspiration for many dwarven, elven, and even giant classical ballads.

One of the most renowned heroes of the war was the giant Hjurnur Wyrmrever, an incredibly powerful frost giant, who killed many dragons single-handedly and was reputed to have challenged Tiamat in a contest of riddles. He lost that contest, however, and had to allow the Queen of Dragons devour his own child. Hjurnur died while killing a dragon king. His story was immortalized in the Saga of the Dragon Queller.

After more than a thousand years of warfare, Ostoria finally reached a truce with dragonkind. Accounts of the nature of the truce were conflicting because many races accounted the event differently. According to the dwarves, the dragons wanted to end the war with the giants because they were fighting in a violent civil war among themselves that led to the separation of the chromatic and metallic species. Giant traditions say that Annam All-Father and Garyx settled the war by playing a game of wah-ree, an ancient abstract strategy board game. The game ended in a stalemate, thus ending the war. After the end of the conflict, the giants dismantled the construct Vonindod.

By the time the war concluded, Ostoria had been reduced to a shadow of its former self. On the day the truce was declared, the nation occupied only the northernmost edge of Faer没n, the areas now known as the Great Glacier, the Cold Lands, and the Savage North. Giants and dragons are still ancient enemies and are constantly on the lookout for any kind of treachery from the other. Even good giant and dragons do not trust each other.
