 >
 > **Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
 >
 > **Spellcasting.** The dragon is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It has the following paladin spells prepared:
 >
 > Cantrip: *blade ward*, *minor illusion*, *true strike*, *chill touch*
 >

 >
 > ### Actions
 > ***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
 >

 >
 > ***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

 ___
 > ### Legendary Actions
 >
 > The dragon can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
 >
 > **Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
 >
 > **Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.
 >
 > **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
 > ### Lair Actions
 > On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
 > * **Sucking Water.** Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.
 > * **Insect Swarm.** A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
 > * **Darkness.** Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. If any of the effect’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

 ___
 > ### Tactics
 > **Decoy.** Xyz uses *silent image* to create an illusion of herself bursting from beneath the water and dashing forth towards a group of adventurers (more than 40' away so she (the illusion) "can't attack" but less than 60' to stay in range of the spell). She uses *minor illusion* to create a deafening roar as the illusion comes busting out of the water. The goal is to have the PCs waste resources on the illusion for one round.
 >
 > **Hit and Run.** Xyz will use her superior flying speed to engage and disengage, using her breath weapon as often as it recharges. She can use *true strike* or *blade ward* to prep for a melee engagement, and then potentially use a Legendary Wing Attack to move away again.
 >
 > **Chill Touch.** If an enemy is mortally wounded Xyz can use *chill touch* to attempt to prevent them from healing and finish them off from a long way away (120').
 >
 > **Web.** Gives a disadvantage on Dex saves which is good for her breath weapon.
 >
 > **Defense.** Her spells *minor illusion*, *disguise self*, *shield*, *fog cloud*, *mirror image*, and *web* can all be used defensively with a little creativity.
 >
 > ### Lore
 > Xyzalgothia was the runt of the clutch and as a result she did not have the size and stamina of her siblings. She had to develop her intellect to survive, and this came easy for her. With her cunning she would pit one sibling against another and then steal their food while they fought.
 >
 > Since she was so small she was often alone, and most of the time went unnoticed. This allowed her to eavesdrop, which she often did to her mother. Once when an necromancer was colluding with her mother Xyz witnessed some of the dark arts from the evil wizard. This intrigued her and she began to spy on him. She witnessed the summoning and interrogation of demons.
 >
 >Gradually over the years she studied stolen spellbooks, and learned how to summon her own demons. She even managed to trick one of her siblings, the bigger bully, to become a sacrifice to a demon in exchange for some fell knowledge about consuming the life essence of other creatures. This she has studied and practiced until it has become a honed skill. When she consumes the heart of a recent deceased creature she can absorb power from it.
