# Faerûn Factions

In the Forgotten Realms, five factions have risen to prominence. Seeking to further their respective agendas while opposing destructive forces that threaten the folk of Faerûn, each faction has its own motivations, goals, and philosophy. While some are more heroic than others, all band together in times of trouble to thwart major threats.

Belonging to a faction sometimes means having responsibilities, but it also carries with it support and rewards for service.

Faction and Alignment are **not** equivalents. There are definitely similarities to the approach between certain factions and alignments, and these are indicated. But a character of any alignment can be a part of any faction, and can usually find a way to promote the factions mantras without compromising their own beliefs.
