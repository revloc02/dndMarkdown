# Tavern Rat Race

## Rules

#### Setup

* Set up 9 dungeon tiles in a square forming a maze
* Each player places a piece of cheese in corners of the maze
* Each player chooses a rat
* Two rats can occupy one space

#### Play

* Roll 1d4 exploding for movement, highest speed move first, same speed moves simultaneously.
* Reaching a piece of cheese means you forfeit any further movement as the rat eats it.
* Should more than one rat reach a cheese or the finish at the same time, a **Fight** ensues.
* A rat that gets some cheese increases the movement dice by one size (which will also explode).
* After each movement round, the DM rolls 1d8, 2d12, and 1d4.
  * Use the d8 to determine which tile exchanges places with the center tile.
  * Use the d12s to determine which tiles are rotated clockwise, and the d4 to determine how many times it is rotated. A roll of 10 or 11 means no rotation, and a 12 means all 9 tiles are rotated. Ignore any duplicates.
* First rat to the finish wins.

#### Fight

All rats roll a d20, highest wins. Ties mean a stalemate and the rats **must** fight again the next round.

#### Stun

You are stunned and cannot move for your next movement (whether it is this turn or the next), but you still apply your Random Event.

#### Alternates

* You can set up different size mazes and use different dice to rotate and move tiles.
