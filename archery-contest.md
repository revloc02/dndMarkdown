# Archery Contests

## Rules

* Make range attacks
* A shot is scored according to what AC it hits (see target)
* Tourneys are the sum of 5 shots
* A critical hit (20) gets an extra 1d4 for additional accuracy
* A critical miss (1) must subtract 1d4 when calculating AC

### Optional Rules

#### Course Mechanics
* **Field Modifier:** The DM may identify a Field Modifier bonus of +1 to +6 for all shots, indicating an easier or shorter archery range. Alternatively the DM can apply a Field Modifier penalty or -1 to -3, indicating a more challenging or longer ranges.
* **Wind:** Wind could be a factor if desired and every shot would have a negative die imposed such as a d4 or d6. (This rule is especially effective in conjunction with a Field Modifier, e.g. Field Modifier of +4, with Wind of -1d4.)

#### Tournament Mechanics
* **Alternate Scoring:** Tourneys can also be the sum of 3 or 7 shots.
* **Varying Ranges:** A tournament could progress over multiple different ranges as shooting rounds proceed. Change the Field Modifier appropriately as the range changes per shooting round.
* **Shooting Contests:** Magic users could be allowed to participate and would use their ranged spell attack bonus and an appropriate spell (i.e. Fire Bolt) for their shots.
* **Magic items:** Magic items are typically not allowed, but the DM may allow exceptions or allow participant to attempt to cheat as he sees fit.
* **Buffs:** Buffs such as Bless or Bane are typically considered at least unsportsmanlike, if not outright cheating, depending on the nature of the contest. Of course, the DM can create any kind of tournament conceivable and allow such things as buffs.

#### Archer Mechanics
* **Feats:** Using feats and class features is appropriate. The Lucky feat would be useful. Grant participants with Crossbow Expert, and Sharpshooter (and Spell Sniper if applicable) advantage on all of their shots.
* **Momentum:** An archer than won the previous round is granted a +1 bonus to the next roll as their confidence swells in that moment.
* **Crowd Support:** Once per contest any archer may make a DC 15 Charisma check and attempt to get the crowd to cheer them on (whether that's overtly or covertly, blatantly or subtly), success means they can take Advantage on the next shot.
* **Intimidation:** Generally Intimidation is considered unsportsmanlike in good natured tournaments (we're all friends here). If desired, allow participants one intimidation check towards a single opponent per shooting round. The two participants roll opposed Intimidation Charisma checks, and the loser has Disadvantage imposed on them for that shot.

### Notes

* **Field Adjustments:** It is very difficult to create an archery contest system that accommodates the wide ranges of abilities found in D&D characters, from the lowly peasant archer up to the 20th level master. This system is a reasonable attempt to cover the most common middle ground and include as much of the extremes as possible. If you find the talent of participants is on the lower end, you can add a Field Modifier bonus and explain it with short range, or indicating that "this is not combat, so everyone gets +4 to hit." Or if the field is extremely skilled, a negative Field Modifier could be imposed upon them, explained by difficult conditions or extreme range. Ultimately a Field Modifier is not mechanically necessary and the contest can still be resolved fairly. But the Field Modifier shifts how easy it is to get a bullseye and allows for making the contest more dramatic and fun.
* **Bullseye:** Your definition of a bullseye matters. You may consider anything in the yellow, a score of a 9 or a 10 to be a bullseye. Or you may want to have a bullseye mean AC 35+, right in the center. Or you might want something in between, the definition is up to you.
* **Professional Archer:** A peasant or NPC specifically trained in Archery Tournaments (meaning they spend their life practicing target-shooting), is considered to have the Sharpshooter feat and thus rolls with Advantage.
* **AC 10:** Technically an AC 10 still hits the target petticoat (the rim of the target outside the last or white ring), but obviously has no value in the count.
