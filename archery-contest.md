### Optional Rules

#### Course Mechanics
* **Field Modifier:** Because of the wide range of skill, these rules make bullseyes impossible for low level characters. To change this, the DM could allow a field bonus of +1 to +6 for all shots, indicating a shorter archery range.
* **Wind:** Wind could be a factor if desired and every shot would have a negative die imposed such as a d4 or d6. (This rule is especially effective in conjunction with a Field Bonus, e.g. Field Bonus of +4, with Wind of -1d4.)

#### Tournament Mechanics
* **Alternate Scoring:** Tourneys can also be the sum of 3 or 7 shots.
* **Varying Ranges:** A tournament could be at multiple different ranges over the course of the shooting rounds. Change the Field Bonus appropriately as the range changes.
* **Shooting Contests:** magic users could be allowed to participate and would use their ranged spell attack bonus and an appropriate spell (i.e. Fire Bolt) for their shots.

#### Archer Mechanics
* **Feats:** Using feats and class features is appropriate. The Lucky feat would be useful. Grant participants with Crossbow Expert, and Sharpshooter (and Spell Sniper if applicable) advantage on their rolls.
* **Professional Archer:** A peasant or NPC specifically trained in Archery Tournaments (meaning they spend their life practicing targeting shooting) could roll with advantage.
* **Momentum:** An archer than won the previous round is granted a +1 bonus to the next roll as their confidence swells in that moment.
* **Crowd Support:** Once per match any archer may make a DC 15 Charisma check and attempt to get the crowd to cheer them on (whether that's overtly or covertly, blatantly or subtly), success means they can take Advantage on the next shot.
* **Intimidation:** Generally Intimidation is considered unsportsmanlike in good natured tournaments (we're all friends here). Allow participants one intimidation check towards a single opponent per shooting round. The two participants roll opposed Intimidation Charisma checks, and the loser has Disadvantage imposed on them.
* **Magic items:** are typically not allowed, but the DM may allow exceptions or potential cheating as he sees fit.
* **Buffs:** Buffs such as Bless or Bane are typically considered at least unsportsmanlike, if not outright cheating, depending on the nature of the contest. Of course, the DM can create any kind of tournament conceivable and allow such things as buffs.

### Notes

* It is very difficult to create an archery contest system that accommodates the wide ranges of abilities found in D&D characters, from the lowly peasant archer up to the 20th level master. This system is a reasonable attempt to hit somewhere in the middle and include as much of the range as possible. If you find the talent of participants is on the lower end you can add a Field Modifier bonus and explain it with short range, or indicating that "this is not combat, so everyone gets +4 to hit." Or a group of extremely high talent could have a negative Field Modifier imposed upon them, explained by difficult conditions or extreme range. Ultimately a Field Modifier is not mechanically necessary and the contest can still be resolved fairly. But the Field Modifier shifts how easy it is to get a bullseye and allows for making the contest more dramatic and fun.
* Bullseye. Your definition of a bullseye matters. You may consider anything in the yellow, a score of a 9 or a 10 to be a bullseye. Or you may want to have a bullseye mean AC 35+, right in the center. Or you might want something in between, the definition is up to you.
* Technically an AC 10 still hits the target stand, but obviously is still 0 points.
