# Giants

___
Giants are very powerful and it might not be in ones best interest to always fight them. In fact, sometimes it is best to just hide or run.

### Hill Giant

* **Height**: 16'
* **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
* **Habitat:** Hills and mountain valleys
* **Ordning:** Physical strength and eating ability

___
**Selfish, Dimwitted Brutes:** Hill giants hunt, forage, and raid in constant search of food. They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, and because of their **laziness** and formidable size and strength, they bully smaller creatures into feeding them. Hill giants dwell in steadings built of rough timber. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the **reek** of the crude animal skins they wear.

* **Height**: 21'
* **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
* **Habitat:** High peaks and glacial rifts
* **Ordning:** Physical might, scars, single combat trophies

___
**Fierce, Hardy Warriors:** Gigantic reavers from the freezing lands beyond civilization, frost giants survive on the spoils of their raids and pillaging. They respect only brute strength and skill in battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they take from their enemies. Frost giants are **barbarians** of ice and snow with hair and beards that are pale white or light blue, matted with frost and clattering with icicles. They dwell in arctic lands where crops don’t grow, but they do keep a little livestock beyond what they capture in their **raids** against civilized lands. They **hunt** the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don’t cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.

### Stone Giant

* **Height**: 18'
* **Alignment**: Neutral
* **Habitat:** Secluded caves
* **Ordning:** Hurling and catching enormous boulders

___
**Reclusive, Quiet, and Peaceful:** Stone giants are peaceful as long as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants with a **stern** countenance. They are private creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world. Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.

In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at **elaborate carvings**. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stonecraft of the dwarves.

### Fire Giant

* **Height**: 18'
* **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
* **Habitat:** Volcanoes, lava floes, and rocky mountains
* **Ordning:** Strength and forgecraft skill

___
**Master Crafters and Organized Warriors:** Fire Giants are ruthless militaristic brutes whose mastery of **metalwork** is legendary. Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants’ forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. Fire giant crafters work through insight and experience rather than the frivolousness of writing or arithmetic. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor.

From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of **war**. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.

### Cloud Giant

* **Height**: 24'
* **Alignment**: Neutral Good or Neutral Evil
* **Habitat:** High mountain peaks, or atop solid clouds
* **Ordning:** Treasure, wealth, and gifts to other cloud giants

___
**Aloof Spellcasters:** Cloud giants live **extravagant** lives high above the world, showing little concern for the plights of other races except as amusement. They are muscular with light skin and have hair of silver or blue. Better spellcasters than most other giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer the wind.

Cloud giants are spread to the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in **castles** on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their fiefs. Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting remnant of the giants’ lost empires.

### Storm Giant

* **Height**: 26'
* **Alignment**: Chaotic Good
* **Habitat:** High in the sky or at the ocean's bottom
* **Ordning:** They don’t compete for status in the ordning

___
**Contemplative Seers:** Storm Giants have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes. They are **benevolent and wise** unless angered, in response to which the fury of a storm giant can affect the fate of thousands. Storm giants live in isolated refuges so far above the surface of the world or below the sea that they are beyond the reach of most other creatures.

Storm giants recall the glory of ancient giant empires and they live out the centuries of their existence in contemplative seclusion, watching for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam’s favor. By reading omens and prophesying, storm giants learn of vast secrets previously unknown and **troves of lore** utterly forgotten.
